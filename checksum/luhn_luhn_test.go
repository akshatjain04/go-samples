FUNCTION_DEF=func Luhn(s []byte) bool 
## Test Scenarios for Luhn function

**Scenario 1: Valid Credit Card Number**

**Details:**
* Description: This test verifies that the Luhn function correctly identifies a valid credit card number.
* Execution:
    * Arrange: Define a valid credit card number as a byte slice.
    * Act: Call the Luhn function with the valid credit card number.
    * Assert: Use the `t.True` function to assert that the returned value is true.
* Validation:
    * The assertion verifies that the Luhn function correctly identifies a valid credit card number.
    * This test is important because it ensures that the function can correctly identify valid credit card numbers, which is crucial for its intended use.

**Scenario 2: Invalid Credit Card Number**

**Details:**
* Description: This test verifies that the Luhn function correctly identifies an invalid credit card number.
* Execution:
    * Arrange: Define an invalid credit card number as a byte slice.
    * Act: Call the Luhn function with the invalid credit card number.
    * Assert: Use the `t.False` function to assert that the returned value is false.
* Validation:
    * The assertion verifies that the Luhn function correctly identifies an invalid credit card number.
    * This test is important because it ensures that the function can correctly distinguish between valid and invalid credit card numbers, which is essential for its security.

**Scenario 3: Empty Credit Card Number**

**Details:**
* Description: This test verifies that the Luhn function handles an empty credit card number gracefully.
* Execution:
    * Arrange: Define an empty byte slice.
    * Act: Call the Luhn function with the empty byte slice.
    * Assert: Use the `t.False` function to assert that the returned value is false.
* Validation:
    * The assertion verifies that the Luhn function returns false for an empty credit card number.
    * This test is important because it ensures that the function can handle invalid input and does not crash or return unexpected results.

**Scenario 4: Credit Card Number with Non-Numeric Characters**

**Details:**
* Description: This test verifies that the Luhn function handles a credit card number with non-numeric characters gracefully.
* Execution:
    * Arrange: Define a credit card number with non-numeric characters as a byte slice.
    * Act: Call the Luhn function with the credit card number with non-numeric characters.
    * Assert: Use the `t.False` function to assert that the returned value is false.
* Validation:
    * The assertion verifies that the Luhn function returns false for a credit card number with non-numeric characters.
    * This test is important because it ensures that the function can handle invalid input and does not crash or return unexpected results.

**Scenario 5: Credit Card Number with Leading or Trailing Whitespace**

**Details:**
* Description: This test verifies that the Luhn function handles a credit card number with leading or trailing whitespace gracefully.
* Execution:
    * Arrange: Define a credit card number with leading or trailing whitespace as a byte slice.
    * Act: Call the Luhn function with the credit card number with leading or trailing whitespace.
    * Assert: Use the `t.False` function to assert that the returned value is false.
* Validation:
    * The assertion verifies that the Luhn function returns false for a credit card number with leading or trailing whitespace.
    * This test is important because it ensures that the function can handle invalid input and does not crash or return unexpected results.

**Scenario 6: Credit Card Number with Internal Whitespace**

**Details:**
* Description: This test verifies that the Luhn function handles a credit card number with internal whitespace gracefully.
* Execution:
    * Arrange: Define a credit card number with internal whitespace as a byte slice.
    * Act: Call the Luhn function with the credit card number with internal whitespace.
    * Assert: Use the `t.False` function to assert that the returned value is false.
* Validation:
    * The assertion verifies that the Luhn function returns false for a credit card number with internal whitespace.
    * This test is important because it ensures that the function can handle invalid input and does not crash or return unexpected results.

These are just a few examples of test scenarios that can be written for the Luhn function. It is important to write comprehensive test scenarios that cover a wide range of inputs and conditions to ensure that the function is working correctly.
