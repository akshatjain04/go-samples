FUNCTION_DEF=func CoinChange(coins []int32, amount int32) int32 
## Test Scenarios for CoinChange Function

### Scenario 1: Empty Coin List

**Description:** This scenario tests the function's behavior when the input coin list is empty.

**Details:**
* **Description:** The function should return 0 when the coin list is empty.
* **Target scenario:** Empty coin list.

**Execution:**
* **Arrange:** Create an empty slice of int32 to represent the coin list.
* **Act:** Call the CoinChange function with the empty coin list and an amount.
* **Assert:** Use the `t.Errorf()` function to verify that the returned value is 0.

**Validation:**
* **Assertion:** Assert that the returned value is 0.
* **Logic:** An empty coin list means there are no coins available for change, therefore, the minimum number of coins required is 0.
* **Importance:** This test ensures the function handles empty input correctly, preventing unexpected behavior.

### Scenario 2: Single Coin and Amount

**Description:** This scenario tests the function with a single coin in the list and an amount equal to the coin value.

**Details:**
* **Description:** The function should return 1 when there is a single coin equal to the amount.
* **Target scenario:** Single coin and amount equal to the coin value.

**Execution:**
* **Arrange:** Create a slice of int32 with a single element equal to the amount.
* **Act:** Call the CoinChange function with the single-element coin list and the amount.
* **Assert:** Use the `t.Errorf()` function to verify that the returned value is 1.

**Validation:**
* **Assertion:** Assert that the returned value is 1.
* **Logic:** Since there is only one coin available and its value matches the amount, only one coin is needed for change.
* **Importance:** This test ensures the function correctly handles scenarios with a single coin and a matching amount.

### Scenario 3: Multiple Coins and Exact Amount

**Description:** This scenario tests the function with multiple coins and an amount that can be formed exactly using the available coins.

**Details:**
* **Description:** The function should return the minimum number of coins required to form the amount.
* **Target scenario:** Multiple coins and an exact amount.

**Execution:**
* **Arrange:** Create a slice of int32 with multiple coins and choose an amount that can be formed exactly using the available coins.
* **Act:** Call the CoinChange function with the multi-element coin list and the chosen amount.
* **Assert:** Use the `t.Errorf()` function to verify that the returned value is the minimum number of coins required to form the amount.

**Validation:**
* **Assertion:** Assert that the returned value is the minimum number of coins required.
* **Logic:** The function should find the optimal combination of coins that forms the exact amount using dynamic programming.
* **Importance:** This test ensures the function correctly calculates the minimum number of coins for various coin combinations and amounts.

### Scenario 4: Multiple Coins and Non-Exact Amount

**Description:** This scenario tests the function with multiple coins and an amount that cannot be formed exactly using the available coins.

**Details:**
* **Description:** The function should return -1 when the amount cannot be formed using the available coins.
* **Target scenario:** Multiple coins and a non-exact amount.

**Execution:**
* **Arrange:** Create a slice of int32 with multiple coins and choose an amount that cannot be formed exactly using the available coins.
* **Act:** Call the CoinChange function with the multi-element coin list and the chosen amount.
* **Assert:** Use the `t.Errorf()` function to verify that the returned value is -1.

**Validation:**
* **Assertion:** Assert that the returned value is -1.
* **Logic:** Since the amount cannot be formed exactly using the available coins, there is no valid combination to return.
* **Importance:** This test ensures the function correctly handles scenarios where the amount cannot be formed using the given coins.

### Scenario 5: Negative Amount

**Description:** This scenario tests the function's behavior when the input amount is negative.

**Details:**
* **Description:** The function should return -1 when the amount is negative.
* **Target scenario:** Negative amount.

**Execution:**
* **Arrange:** Choose a negative amount.
* **Act:** Call the CoinChange function with any coin list and the negative amount.
* **Assert:** Use the `t.Errorf()` function to verify that the returned value is -1.

**Validation:**
* **Assertion:** Assert that the returned value is -1.
* **Logic:** Negative amounts do not represent valid change scenarios.
* **Importance:** This test ensures the function handles negative input appropriately, preventing unexpected behavior.

### Scenario 6: Large Amount

**Description:** This scenario tests the function's performance with a large amount.

**Details:**
* **Description:** The function should handle large amounts efficiently without excessive runtime or memory consumption.
* **Target scenario:** Large amount.

**Execution:**
* **Arrange:** Choose a large amount.
* **Act:** Call the CoinChange function with any coin list and the large amount.
* **Assert:** Measure the execution time and memory usage of the function.

**Validation:**
* **Assertion:** Assert that the execution time and memory usage are within acceptable limits.
* **Logic:** The function should scale efficiently for large amounts.
* **Importance:** This test ensures the function performs well under real-world scenarios with potentially large amounts.

These test scenarios cover various aspects of the CoinChange function, including normal operation, edge cases, and error handling. They ensure the function behaves correctly under different input conditions and meets performance expectations.
