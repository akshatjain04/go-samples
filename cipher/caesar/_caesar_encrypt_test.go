## Test Scenarios for Caesar Cipher Encryption Function

Here are some test scenarios for the `Encrypt` function in the `caesar` package:

**Scenario 1: Encrypting a single letter with a positive key shift**

**Details:**

* Description: This test checks if the function correctly encrypts a single letter using a positive key shift.
* Target scenario: Encrypting a single lowercase letter with a key shift of 3.

**Execution:**

* Arrange: Create a test case with the input letter 'a' and the key 3.
* Act: Call the `Encrypt` function with the input letter and key.
* Assert: Use the `testing.T.Errorf` function to verify that the encrypted letter is 'd'.

**Validation:**

* The assertion verifies that the encrypted letter matches the expected output based on the Caesar cipher algorithm.
* This test is important because it ensures the basic functionality of the encryption algorithm for single letters.

**Scenario 2: Encrypting a single letter with a negative key shift**

**Details:**

* Description: This test checks if the function correctly encrypts a single letter using a negative key shift.
* Target scenario: Encrypting a single uppercase letter with a key shift of -13.

**Execution:**

* Arrange: Create a test case with the input letter 'Z' and the key -13.
* Act: Call the `Encrypt` function with the input letter and key.
* Assert: Use the `testing.T.Errorf` function to verify that the encrypted letter is 'N'.

**Validation:**

* The assertion verifies that the encrypted letter matches the expected output based on the Caesar cipher algorithm, considering the wrapping around of the alphabet.
* This test is important because it ensures the correct handling of negative key shifts.

**Scenario 3: Encrypting a word with a key shift**

**Details:**

* Description: This test checks if the function correctly encrypts a word using a key shift.
* Target scenario: Encrypting the word "hello" with a key shift of 10.

**Execution:**

* Arrange: Create a test case with the input word "hello" and the key 10.
* Act: Call the `Encrypt` function with the input word and key.
* Assert: Use the `testing.T.Errorf` function to verify that the encrypted word is "khoor".

**Validation:**

* The assertion verifies that the encrypted word matches the expected output based on the Caesar cipher algorithm applied to each letter individually.
* This test is important because it ensures the correct encryption of words, which is a common use case for the Caesar cipher.

**Scenario 4: Encrypting a sentence with a key shift**

**Details:**

* Description: This test checks if the function correctly encrypts a sentence using a key shift.
* Target scenario: Encrypting the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." with a key shift of 10.

**Execution:**

* Arrange: Create a test case with the input sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." and the key 10.
* Act: Call the `Encrypt` function with the input sentence and key.
* Assert: Use the `testing.T.Errorf` function to verify that the encrypted sentence is "Dro aesmu lbygx pyh tewzc yfob dro vkji nyq.".

**Validation:**

* The assertion verifies that the encrypted sentence matches the expected output based on the Caesar cipher algorithm applied to each letter individually, including spaces and punctuation.
* This test is important because it ensures the correct encryption of sentences, which is another common use case for the Caesar cipher.

**Scenario 5: Encrypting a string with a key shift of 0**

**Details:**

* Description: This test checks if the function correctly handles a key shift of 0, which should result in no change to the input string.
* Target scenario: Encrypting the string "no change" with a key shift of 0.

**Execution:**

* Arrange: Create a test case with the input string "no change" and the key 0.
* Act: Call the `Encrypt` function with the input string and key.
* Assert: Use the `testing.T.Errorf` function to verify that the encrypted string is "no change".

**Validation:**

* The assertion verifies that the encrypted string is identical to the input string, indicating that a key shift of 0 has no effect.
* This test is important because it ensures the correct handling of edge cases, such as a key shift of 0.

**Scenario 6: Encrypting an empty string**

**Details:**

* Description: This test checks if the function correctly handles an empty input string.
* Target scenario: Encrypting an empty string with a key shift of 10.

**Execution:**

* Arrange: Create a test case with an empty input string and the key 10.
* Act: Call the `Encrypt` function with the empty input string and key.
* Assert: Use the `testing.T.Errorf` function to verify that the encrypted string is also empty.

**Validation:**

* The assertion verifies that the encrypted string is empty, indicating that the function correctly handles empty input strings.
* This test is important because it ensures the correct handling of edge cases, such as empty input strings.

**Scenario 7: Encrypting a string with non-alphabetic characters**

**Details:**

* Description: This test checks if the function correctly handles non-alphabetic characters in the input string.
* Target scenario: Encrypting the string "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. 123!@#" with a key shift of 10.

**Execution:**

* Arrange: Create a test case with the input string "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. 123!@#" and the key 10.
* Act: Call the `Encrypt` function with the input string and key.
* Assert: Use the `testing.T.Errorf` function to verify that the encrypted string contains the non-alphabetic characters in their original positions.

**Validation:**

* The assertion verifies that the encrypted string contains the non-alphabetic characters in their original positions, indicating that the function correctly ignores non-alphabetic characters.
* This test is important because it ensures the correct handling of various input strings, including those with non-alphabetic characters.

These test scenarios cover various aspects of the `Encrypt` function, ensuring its correct functionality under different conditions. You can further expand these scenarios to include more edge cases and specific use cases relevant to your application.
