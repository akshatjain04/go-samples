1. Scenario: Test with positive integers
   - Given base as 1, value as 2, and values as [3, 4, 5]
   - This scenario will check the functionality of the function with positive integers.

2. Scenario: Test with negative integers
   - Given base as 1, value as -2, and values as [-3, -4, -5]
   - This scenario will check how the function behaves with negative integers.

3. Scenario: Test with a mixture of positive and negative integers
   - Given base as 1, value as 2, and values as [-3, 4, -5]
   - This scenario will check the functionality of the function with a mixture of positive and negative integers.

4. Scenario: Test with base as zero
   - Given base as 0, value as 2, and values as [3, 4, 5]
   - This scenario will check the functionality of the function when the base is zero.

5. Scenario: Test with value as zero
   - Given base as 1, value as 0, and values as [3, 4, 5]
   - This scenario will check the functionality of the function when the initial value is zero.

6. Scenario: Test with values array as empty
   - Given base as 1, value as 2, and values as []
   - This scenario will check the functionality of the function when the values array is empty.

7. Scenario: Test with large numbers
   - Given base as 10, value as 1000, and values as [2000, 3000, 4000]
   - This scenario will check the performance and functionality of the function with large numbers.

8. Scenario: Test with all zeros
   - Given base as 0, value as 0, and values as [0, 0, 0]
   - This scenario will check the functionality of the function when all inputs are zero.

9. Scenario: Test with base greater than value and values
   - Given base as 10, value as 2, and values as [3, 4, 5]
   - This scenario will check the functionality of the function when the base is greater than the value and values in the array.
