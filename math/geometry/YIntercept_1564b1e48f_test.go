Test generated by RoostGPT for test go-samples-test using AI Type Azure Open AI and AI Model roost-gpt4-32k

Scenario 1: Testing with positive x and y coordinates
In this scenario, you would need to test how the function behaves when both the x and y values of the point are positive.

Scenario 2: Testing with negative x and y coordinates
Here, you would test the function's behavior when both the x and y values of the point are negative.

Scenario 3: Testing with x = 0
This scenario will help you understand the function's behavior when the x value of the point is zero.

Scenario 4: Testing with y = 0
In this scenario, the y value of the point is zero. This test is important because the calculation involves a subtraction of the y value.

Scenario 5: Testing with positive slope
Here, you would test how the function performs with a positive slope value.

Scenario 6: Testing with negative slope
This test would be for understanding the function's behavior with a negative slope value.

Scenario 7: Testing with slope = 0
In this case, the slope value is zero, and you want to know how the function performs.

Scenario 8: Testing with large positive and negative numbers
This test scenario will provide insights about the function's handling of large numbers.

Scenario 9: Testing with decimal points
This scenario would test the function's response to decimal values and precision handling.

In addition to these scenarios, it'd be good to include scenarios for nil inputs, edge cases, and possibly very large floating point numbers.
