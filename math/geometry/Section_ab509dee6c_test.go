Test generated by RoostGPT for test go-samples-test using AI Type Azure Open AI and AI Model roost-gpt4-32k

1. Test when Point p1 and Point p2 are the same: The expected Section Point should be the same as p1 and p2.
2. Test when Point p1 is at the origin (0,0) and Point p2 is any other point: The expected Section Point should be a Point on the line from the origin to Point p2 according to the ratio r.
3. Test when Point p2 is at the origin (0,0) and Point p1 is any other point: Similar to test case 2, the expected Section Point should be a Point on the line from the origin to Point p1 according to the ratio r.
4. Test when both Point p1 and p2 have positive coordinates: The expected Section Point's coordinates should be positive.
5. Test when both Point p1 and p1 have negative coordinates: The expected Section Point's coordinates should be negative.
6. Test when Point p1 has positive coordinates and Point p2 has negative coordinates: The expected Section Point's coordinates will depend on the value of r.
7. Test when Point p1 has negative coordinates and Point p2 has positive coordinates: Same as test case 6, the expected Section Point's coordinates will depend on the value of r.
8. Test when r = 0:  The Section Point should be the same as p1.
9. Test when r = 1: The Section Point should be the average of the coordinates of Point p1 and p2.
10. Test when r is very large: The Section Point should be very close to p2.
11. Test when r is a small positive fraction: The Section Point should be very close to p1.
12. Test when r is negative: The behavior of the function is not specified for this case, so the result is unpredictable.
13. Test with two Points on the x-axis: The Section Point should also be on the x-axis.
14. Test with two Points on the y-axis: The Section Point should also be on the y-axis.
15. Test with two Points along a diagonal line (45 degrees): The Section Point should lie on the same diagonal line.
16. Test if it correctly handles floating point precision when the coordinates are large numbers.
17. Test if the function retains precision when r is a floating point number.
