Test Scenarios:

 1. Scenario: Both lines are vertical
    Given two vertical lines, when the IsParallel function is called, then it should return True.

 2. Scenario: Both lines are horizontal
    Given two horizontal lines, when the IsParallel function is called, then it should return True.

 3. Scenario: Both lines have the same slope
    Given two lines that both have a positive slope of 0.5, when the IsParallel function is called, then it should return True.

 4. Scenario: Both lines have the same negative slope
    Given two lines that both have a negative slope of -0.5, when the IsParallel function is called, then it should return True.

 5. Scenario: The lines have different slopes
    Given one line with a slope of 0.5, and another line with a slope of 0.6, when the IsParallel function is called, then it should return False.

 6. Scenario: One line is vertical and the other line is not vertical
    Given one vertical line and another line with a slope other than undefined, when the IsParallel function is called, then it should return False.

 7. Scenario: One line is horizontal and the other line is not horizontal
    Given one horizontal line and another line with a slope other than zero, when the IsParallel function is called, then it should return False.

 8. Scenario: The lines overlap
    Given two identical lines, when the IsParallel function is called, then it should return True.

 9. Scenario: The lines are null
    Given two null lines, when the IsParallel function is called, it should handle/null-check the input and return an appropriate value or error message.

 10. Scenario: One of the lines is null
    Given one valid line and one null line, when the IsParallel function is called, it should handle/null-check the input and return an appropriate value or error message.

In edge case scenarios (9 and 10), the function should be able to handle null inputs, but as it stands, it does not appear to be capable of that.
