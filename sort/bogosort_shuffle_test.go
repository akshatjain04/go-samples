FUNCTION_DEF=func shuffle[T constraints.Number](arr []T) 
Scenario 1: Testing the shuffle function with a normal sequence of numbers

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the shuffle function can successfully shuffle a sequence of numbers in an array. We will use a sequence of numbers from 1 to 5 for this test.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an array with a sequence of numbers from 1 to 5.
  Act: Call the shuffle function on the array.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the output array is a permutation of the input array.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the fact that the shuffle function should return a shuffled version of the input array, i.e., a permutation of the input array. This test is important to ensure that the shuffle function correctly shuffles an array of numbers.

Scenario 2: Testing the shuffle function with an array of same numbers

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the shuffle function can handle an array where all the numbers are the same. We will use an array of five 1's for this test.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an array with five 1's.
  Act: Call the shuffle function on the array.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the output array is the same as the input array.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the fact that shuffling an array of same numbers should return the same array. This test is important to ensure that the shuffle function can handle edge cases where all the numbers in the array are the same.

Scenario 3: Testing the shuffle function with an empty array

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the shuffle function can handle an empty array. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an empty array.
  Act: Call the shuffle function on the array.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the output array is also empty.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the fact that shuffling an empty array should return an empty array. This test is important to ensure that the shuffle function can handle edge cases where the array is empty.

Scenario 4: Testing the shuffle function with a large array

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the shuffle function can handle a large array. We will use an array of size 10^6 for this test.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an array of size 10^6 with random numbers.
  Act: Call the shuffle function on the array.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the output array is a permutation of the input array.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the fact that the shuffle function should return a shuffled version of the input array, i.e., a permutation of the input array. This test is important to ensure that the shuffle function can handle large inputs.

Scenario 5: Testing the shuffle function with negative numbers

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the shuffle function can handle an array with negative numbers. We will use an array of five negative numbers for this test.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an array with five negative numbers.
  Act: Call the shuffle function on the array.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the output array is a permutation of the input array.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the fact that the shuffle function should return a shuffled version of the input array, i.e., a permutation of the input array. This test is important to ensure that the shuffle function can handle arrays with negative numbers.
