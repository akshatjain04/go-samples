FUNCTION_DEF=func shuffle[T constraints.Number](arr []T) 
Scenario 1: Shuffle a non-empty slice of integers

Details:
  Description: The test checks if the shuffle function randomizes the order of elements in a non-empty integer slice.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a non-empty slice of integers with known values.
  Act: Invoke the shuffle function on the slice.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the elements are in a different order, and all original elements are present.
Validation:
  The assertion will check if the shuffled slice has the same elements as the original but in a different order. The importance of the test is to ensure the shuffle function works as expected for typical input.

Scenario 2: Shuffle an empty slice

Details:
  Description: The test verifies that shuffling an empty slice does not result in any errors or changes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty slice of integers.
  Act: Invoke the shuffle function on the slice.
  Assert: Confirm that the resulting slice remains empty.
Validation:
  The assertion will validate that the slice is still empty, ensuring that the shuffle function can handle empty slices gracefully.

Scenario 3: Shuffle a slice with one element

Details:
  Description: The test checks that shuffling a slice with only one element does not alter the slice, as there are no other elements to shuffle with.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a slice of integers with a single element.
  Act: Invoke the shuffle function on the slice.
  Assert: Ensure that the slice remains unchanged after shuffling.
Validation:
  The assertion will confirm that the single-element slice is unchanged, as this is the expected behavior when there's only one possible order.

Scenario 4: Shuffle a slice of floating-point numbers

Details:
  Description: The test ensures that the shuffle function can handle slices of floating-point numbers and properly randomizes their order.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a non-empty slice of floating-point numbers with known values.
  Act: Invoke the shuffle function on the slice.
  Assert: Check that the elements are in a different order, and all original elements are present.
Validation:
  The assertion will check for the presence of all original elements in a new order, validating the function's ability to handle different numeric types due to its generic nature.

Scenario 5: Shuffle a large slice

Details:
  Description: The test assesses the function's performance and correctness when shuffling a very large slice.
Execution:
  Arrange: Generate a large slice of integers (e.g., 10,000 elements).
  Act: Invoke the shuffle function on the large slice.
  Assert: Verify that the shuffled slice contains all original elements in a different order.
Validation:
  The assertion will confirm that no elements have been lost or duplicated and that the order has been randomized, ensuring the function scales well with input size.

Scenario 6: Shuffle stability with the same seed

Details:
  Description: The test checks if the shuffle function produces the same output for the same input and random seed, ensuring deterministic behavior for testing and debugging.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a specific seed using `rand.Seed` before creating a slice of integers.
  Act: Invoke the shuffle function multiple times on identical slices with the same seed set before each shuffle.
  Assert: Confirm that the resulting slices are identical for each shuffle.
Validation:
  The assertion will validate that the shuffling is deterministic when the random seed is controlled, which is crucial for reproducibility in tests and debugging sessions.

Scenario 7: Shuffle with different numeric types

Details:
  Description: The test ensures that the shuffle function is compatible with different numeric types (e.g., int8, int16, int32, int64, uint, float32, float64) due to the use of generics.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create slices of various numeric types with known values.
  Act: Invoke the shuffle function on each slice.
  Assert: Check that the elements in each slice are in a different order, and all original elements are present.
Validation:
  The assertion will verify that the function is truly generic and can handle various numeric types, which is essential for a function meant to operate on any constraints.Number type.
