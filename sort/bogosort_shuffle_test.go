FUNCTION_DEF=func shuffle[T constraints.Number](arr []T) 
Scenario 1: Valid input with positive integers

Details:
  Description: The test verifies that the shuffle function can handle a slice of positive integers and that the resulting slice is a permutation of the original slice.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a slice of positive integers.
  Act: Invoke the `shuffle` function with the created slice.
  Assert: Check that the shuffled slice has the same length and contains the same elements as the original slice, but in a different order.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the shuffle function does not lose or duplicate elements during the shuffle process. The order of elements should be different, as the shuffle operation is expected to randomize the order. This test is important to verify that the shuffle function works correctly with standard input.

Scenario 2: Valid input with negative integers

Details:
  Description: This test checks whether the shuffle function can correctly handle a slice of negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a slice of negative integers.
  Act: Invoke the `shuffle` function with the created slice.
  Assert: Verify that the shuffled slice contains the same elements and has the same length as the original slice, but in a potentially different order.
Validation:
  The assertion checks for the integrity and completeness of the shuffle operation when negative integers are present. It is important to ensure that the shuffle function is not biased towards positive numbers and works consistently across different numeric domains.

Scenario 3: Valid input with floating-point numbers

Details:
  Description: This test ensures that the shuffle function can shuffle a slice of floating-point numbers correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a slice of floating-point numbers.
  Act: Invoke the `shuffle` function with the created slice.
  Assert: Confirm that the shuffled slice has the same length and contains the same elements as the original slice, possibly in a different order.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the shuffle function maintains the elements and their counts while shuffling floating-point numbers. This test verifies that the function works with non-integer number types, which is important for applications that require shuffling of floating-point slices.

Scenario 4: Empty slice input

Details:
  Description: This test checks the shuffle function's behavior when provided with an empty slice.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty slice of numbers.
  Act: Invoke the `shuffle` function with the empty slice.
  Assert: Verify that the shuffled slice is still empty.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the shuffle function can handle edge cases, such as an empty slice, without throwing errors or altering the slice. This test ensures robustness in the function's error handling and is critical for preventing unexpected behavior in edge cases.

Scenario 5: Single element slice input

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the shuffle function can handle a slice with only one element without altering the slice.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a slice with a single element.
  Act: Invoke the `shuffle` function with the single-element slice.
  Assert: Check that the shuffled slice is identical to the original since there are no other elements to shuffle with.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the shuffle function behaves as expected when there's nothing to shuffle. This test is important because it checks the function's behavior with the minimum possible input that does not require shuffling.

Scenario 6: Large input slice

Details:
  Description: This test assesses the shuffle function's performance and behavior with a large input slice.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a large slice of numbers.
  Act: Invoke the `shuffle` function with the large slice.
  Assert: Verify that the shuffled slice has the same length and contains the same elements as the original slice, in a different order.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the shuffle function can handle large volumes of data without crashing or taking an impractical amount of time. This test is important for assessing the function's scalability and efficiency.

Scenario 7: Input slice with duplicates

Details:
  Description: This test ensures that the shuffle function can handle slices with duplicate elements correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a slice with duplicate numbers.
  Act: Invoke the `shuffle` function with the slice containing duplicates.
  Assert: Confirm that the shuffled slice has the same length and contains the same elements (including duplicates) as the original slice, in a different order.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the shuffle function maintains the count of each element while shuffling. This test is crucial for applications that may involve shuffling slices with non-unique elements and expect the frequency of each element to be preserved.
