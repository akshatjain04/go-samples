## Test Scenarios for ColorUsingBacktracking function

### Scenario 1: Coloring a simple graph with no cycles

**Details:**
This scenario checks if the function can correctly color a simple graph with no cycles.

**Execution:**
* Arrange: Create a simple graph with 4 vertices and 3 edges.
* Act: Call the ColorUsingBacktracking function on the graph.
* Assert: Verify that the function returns a map with each vertex assigned a valid color and the number of colors used is correct.

**Validation:**
The assertion verifies that the function can correctly assign colors to vertices in a graph without cycles. This is important to ensure that the algorithm works for basic graphs.

### Scenario 2: Coloring a graph with cycles

**Details:**
This scenario checks if the function can correctly color a graph with cycles.

**Execution:**
* Arrange: Create a graph with 4 vertices and 4 edges, forming a cycle.
* Act: Call the ColorUsingBacktracking function on the graph.
* Assert: Verify that the function returns a map with each vertex assigned a valid color and the number of colors used is correct.

**Validation:**
The assertion verifies that the function can handle cycles in the graph and still assign valid colors to all vertices. This is important to ensure that the algorithm works for more complex graphs.

### Scenario 3: Coloring a graph with isolated vertices

**Details:**
This scenario checks if the function can correctly color a graph with isolated vertices.

**Execution:**
* Arrange: Create a graph with 4 vertices and 2 edges, where two vertices are isolated.
* Act: Call the ColorUsingBacktracking function on the graph.
* Assert: Verify that the function returns a map with each vertex assigned a valid color, including the isolated vertices, and the number of colors used is correct.

**Validation:**
The assertion verifies that the function can handle isolated vertices in the graph and still assign valid colors to all vertices. This is important to ensure that the algorithm works for graphs with different structures.

### Scenario 4: Coloring a graph with an invalid edge

**Details:**
This scenario checks if the function handles invalid edges in the graph.

**Execution:**
* Arrange: Create a graph with 4 vertices and 3 edges, where one edge connects two non-adjacent vertices.
* Act: Call the ColorUsingBacktracking function on the graph.
* Assert: Verify that the function returns an error indicating the invalid edge.

**Validation:**
The assertion verifies that the function can detect and handle invalid edges in the graph, preventing unexpected behavior. This is important to ensure the robustness of the algorithm.

### Scenario 5: Coloring a graph with a large number of vertices

**Details:**
This scenario checks if the function can handle a graph with a large number of vertices efficiently.

**Execution:**
* Arrange: Create a graph with 100 vertices and a moderate number of edges.
* Act: Call the ColorUsingBacktracking function on the graph.
* Assert: Verify that the function returns a map with each vertex assigned a valid color and the execution time is within a reasonable limit.

**Validation:**
The assertion verifies that the function can scale to handle graphs with a large number of vertices without excessive performance degradation. This is important for real-world applications with large graphs.

These are just a few examples of test scenarios for the ColorUsingBacktracking function. More scenarios can be created to cover different aspects of the function's behavior and edge cases.
