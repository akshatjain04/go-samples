Test generated by RoostGPT for test MiniProjects using AI Type Azure Open AI and AI Model roost-gpt4-32k

1. Positive Test scenario where Graph is not empty and contains uncolored vertices. The expected result is a Graph with all vertices colored properly and with an accurate count of colors used.

2. Positive Test scenario where Graph is already colored and contains no uncolored vertices. The expected result is a count of colors used accurately portraying the input Graph's coloring.

3. Negative Test scenario where Graph is empty (no vertices). The function is expected to return an empty map and the count of colors as zero.

4. Positive Test scenario where Graph has vertices but no edges. The function is expected to color all vertices with the same color (Color=1) and the count of colors used should be 1.

5. Edge Test scenario where Graph has vertices and each vertex is connected to all other vertices. The function is expected to color each vertex with a different color and the count of colors used should be equal to the number of vertices.

6. Edge Test scenario where Graph is a tree (a special type of graph where it has no cycles). The function is expected to color the graph with the minimum number of colors possible (depending on the maximum degree of the graph).

7. Random Test scenario where vertices are randomly connected with each other. This test ensures the correctness of the function under unpredictable and structured data.

8. Performance Test scenario where Graph contains a large number of vertices and edges. This test checks whether the function can handle large inputs efficiently.

9. Negative Test scenario where Graph initially contains colored vertices with incorrect colors. The function should correct the colors of vertices and produce an accurate count of colors used.

10. Test scenario where Graph contains loops (a vertex connected to itself). The function must handle the loop properly and color the graph accordingly.

11. Test scenario where Graph contains disconnected components. The function should handle the disconnected components separately, color them, and return the correct count of colors used.
