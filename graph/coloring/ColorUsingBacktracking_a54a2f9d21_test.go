/*
Test generated by RoostGPT for test MiniProjects using AI Type Azure Open AI and AI Model roost-gpt4-32k

1. Test scenario where the function is handling an empty Graph. Validate that the returned map is also empty and colors used is zero.

2. Validate that the function handles a Graph with no edges correctly. The number of colors used should be one and every vertex should be assigned the same color.

3. Validate that the function can handle a scenario where each vertex is connected to each other (for instance a node ring). The expected output should be alternating colors across vertices and the total number of colors used should be 2.

4. Validate that the function can handle scenario where it needs more than 2 colors for coloring the graph. A graph where a minimum of 3 colors is required would be a good example for this.

5. Validate that vertices array doesn't contain invalid data like negative values or values greater than the size of the graph.

6. Validate that when same graph is passed twice, the function returns consistent results. Should test the function's reliability and consistency.

7. Validate the function's performance by passing a large-sized graph and ensuring that the function is able to complete in reasonable time.

8. Test scenario where the graph passed is null. The method should handle this gracefully.

9. Validate that the color assigned to each vertex is unique among its neighboring vertices.

10. Validate that the number of colors used returned by function is correct by comparing it with the unique list of colors present in vertexColors.

11. Check the function's behavior when called concurrently. It might uncover some race conditions if present.
