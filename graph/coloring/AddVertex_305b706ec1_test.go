Test generated by RoostGPT for test MiniProjects using AI Type Azure Open AI and AI Model roost-gpt4-32k

Test Scenario 1: Empty Graph
Test the AddVertex function with an empty graph. After adding a vertex, verify that the graph contains one vertex.

Test Scenario 2: Graph with Existing Vertices
Test the AddVertex function with a graph that already includes some vertices. After adding a new, unique vertex, verify that the total number of vertices is increased by one.

Test Scenario 3: Duplicate Vertex Addition
Test the AddVertex function with a duplicate vertex. When a vertex is added to the graph that already contains this vertex, the number of vertices in the graph should remain unchanged.

Test Scenario 4: Negative Vertex
Test the AddVertex function with a negative vertex. Although vertices are usually assigned natural numbers, this implementation appears to allow for any integer, including negatives. Verify that the function behaves correctly in this case.

Test Scenario 5: Large Vertex
Test the AddVertex function with a large vertex. Verify that the function can handle upper limit cases.

Test Scenario 6: Adding Multiple Vertices
Test the AddVertex function by adding multiple vertices, ensuring that all vertices are added successfully and the count of vertices is increased accordingly.

Test Scenario 7: Vertex Zero
Test the AddVertex function with zero as a vertex. While the default value for the integer type in Go is zero, this function should be able to handle zero as a unique vertex.

Test Scenario 8: Adding More Than One Duplicate Vertices
Test adding the same vertex multiple times to the graph. The count of vertices should still remain the same since a duplicate vertex does not count as a new vertex.

Test Scenario 9: Adding Concurrent Vertices
Test a scenario where vertices are added consecutively in a sequence, and validate whether the graph is able to maintain its structure and vertex count accurately.
