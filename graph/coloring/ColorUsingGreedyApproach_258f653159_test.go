Test generated by RoostGPT for test MiniProjects using AI Type Azure Open AI and AI Model roost-gpt4-32k

Test Scenario 1: Data Structure Validation
- Validate if the graph structure is correctly designed with a valid number of vertices and correctly established edges.

Test Scenario 2: Vertex Ordering
- Validate if the vertices are ordered according to their degree. The vertices with the higher degree should come first.

Test Scenario 3: Check for Color Assignment
- Validate if the colors are being assigned to the vertices correctly according to the greedy coloring logic. No two adjacent vertices should have the same color.

Test Scenario 4: Early Termination Check
- Validate if the function terminates as soon as all the vertices are colored, it shouldn't wait for all the "colors up to the number of vertices" to be tested.

Test Scenario 5: Invalid Graph Structure Comprehensive Testing
- Try to break the algorithm by providing invalid graph structure input, for example, a negative number of vertices or undefined edges.

Test Scenario 6: Zero Vertices
- Test the algorithm on a graph with zero vertices. The output should be an empty color map.

Test Scenario 7: Single Vertex
- Test the algorithm on a graph with a single vertex. The output should be a color map with only one entry.

Test Scenario 8: All Vertices Are Independent
- Test the algorithm on a graph where all vertices are independent, i.e., no edges between them. All vertices should be colored with the same color.

Test Scenario 9: Complete Graph
- Test the algorithm on a complete graph where each vertex is connected to every other vertex, in this case, every vertex should have a different color.

Test Scenario 10: Balanced Graph
- Test the algorithm on a balanced graph, where each vertex has an equal number of edges. The output should reflect this balanced property in the color distribution.

Test Scenario 11: Edge Case for Large Input
- Test the algorithm performance and correctness on a graph with a large number of vertices and edges.
