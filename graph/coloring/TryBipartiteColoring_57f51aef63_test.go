Test generated by RoostGPT for test MiniProjects using AI Type Azure Open AI and AI Model roost-gpt4-32k

1. Scenario: Test TryBipartiteColoring method with a graph that is completely disconnected. Verify that the function assigns color "1" to all the vertices as each vertex is an individual component.

2. Scenario: Test TryBipartiteColoring method with a graph that is already bipartite. Verify that it provides a correct color assignment that maintains the bipartite nature of the graph.

3. Scenario: Test TryBipartiteColoring method with a graph that is not bipartite. The function should assign colors but the coloring will not result in two separate groups without intersection.

4. Scenario: Test TryBipartiteColoring method with an empty graph (no edges and no vertices). The function should return an empty color map since there are no vertices present in the graph.

5. Scenario: Test TryBipartiteColoring function with a graph where some vertices are connected by a single edge. The vertices connected by edge should have different colors.

6. Scenario: Test the TryBipartiteColoring method on a dense graph where each vertex is connected to every other vertex. Observe and test the color assignment logic provided by the function.

7. Scenario: Perform stress test by providing graph with a large number of vertices and edges. Confirm function performance and response time.

8. Scenario: Test the TryBipartiteColoring function with a graph where all vertices are connected in a chain. Verify the colors assigned by the function toggle for each subsequent node.

9. Scenario: Test the TryBipartiteColoring method with a graph that contains loops/ cycles. Verify if the function can correctly assign colors that make the graph bipartite.

10. Scenario: Test with a graph containing multiple disconnected components. Each disconnected component should be independently evaluated for bipartite coloring. Check the color assignment in each component.

Please note: Color "1" and "2" are two different groups as per bipartite nature of the graph and color "0" is a default color assigned to all nodes initially.
