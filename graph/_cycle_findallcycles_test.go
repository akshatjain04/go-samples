FUNCTION_DEF=func (g *Graph) FindAllCycles() []Graph
## Test Scenarios for FindAllCycles function

### Scenario 1: Empty Graph

**Description:** This scenario tests the behavior of the function when the graph is empty.

**Details:**
* Arrange: Create an empty graph using the `Graph` struct.
* Act: Call the `FindAllCycles` function on the empty graph.
* Assert: Verify that the function returns an empty slice of graphs.

**Validation:** This scenario verifies that the function handles empty graphs correctly, which is important for ensuring its robustness.

### Scenario 2: Single Node Graph

**Description:** This scenario tests the behavior of the function when the graph consists of a single node.

**Details:**
* Arrange: Create a graph with a single node using the `Graph` struct.
* Act: Call the `FindAllCycles` function on the single-node graph.
* Assert: Verify that the function returns an empty slice of graphs.

**Validation:** This scenario verifies that the function handles single-node graphs correctly, which is important for ensuring its correctness in basic cases.

### Scenario 3: Directed Graph with a Cycle

**Description:** This scenario tests the behavior of the function when the graph is directed and contains a cycle.

**Details:**
* Arrange: Create a directed graph with a cycle using the `Graph` struct.
* Act: Call the `FindAllCycles` function on the directed graph with a cycle.
* Assert: Verify that the function returns a slice of graphs containing the cycle.

**Validation:** This scenario verifies that the function correctly identifies and returns cycles in directed graphs, which is its primary purpose.

### Scenario 4: Undirected Graph with a Cycle

**Description:** This scenario tests the behavior of the function when the graph is undirected and contains a cycle.

**Details:**
* Arrange: Create an undirected graph with a cycle using the `Graph` struct.
* Act: Call the `FindAllCycles` function on the undirected graph with a cycle.
* Assert: Verify that the function returns a slice of graphs containing the cycle.

**Validation:** This scenario verifies that the function correctly identifies and returns cycles in undirected graphs, which is important for its completeness.

### Scenario 5: Multiple Cycles

**Description:** This scenario tests the behavior of the function when the graph contains multiple cycles.

**Details:**
* Arrange: Create a graph with multiple cycles using the `Graph` struct.
* Act: Call the `FindAllCycles` function on the graph with multiple cycles.
* Assert: Verify that the function returns a slice of graphs containing all the cycles.

**Validation:** This scenario verifies that the function can handle and return all cycles within a graph, which is important for its comprehensiveness.

### Scenario 6: Disconnected Graph

**Description:** This scenario tests the behavior of the function when the graph is disconnected.

**Details:**
* Arrange: Create a disconnected graph using the `Graph` struct.
* Act: Call the `FindAllCycles` function on the disconnected graph.
* Assert: Verify that the function returns an empty slice of graphs or only cycles within connected components.

**Validation:** This scenario verifies that the function handles disconnected graphs correctly, which is important for ensuring its robustness in various graph structures.

### Scenario 7: Negative Edge Weights

**Description:** This scenario tests the behavior of the function when the graph contains negative edge weights.

**Details:**
* Arrange: Create a graph with negative edge weights using the `Graph` struct.
* Act: Call the `FindAllCycles` function on the graph with negative edge weights.
* Assert: Verify that the function handles negative edge weights correctly, either by returning an error or by adjusting its cycle detection logic.

**Validation:** This scenario verifies that the function can handle graphs with negative edge weights, which is important for its applicability in various real-world scenarios.

### Scenario 8: Large Graph

**Description:** This scenario tests the performance of the function when the graph is large.

**Details:**
* Arrange: Create a large graph using the `Graph` struct.
* Act: Call the `FindAllCycles` function on the large graph.
* Assert: Verify that the function completes within a reasonable time frame.

**Validation:** This scenario verifies that the function scales well with the size of the graph, which is important for its practical use in large-scale applications.

## Conclusion

These test scenarios cover various aspects of the `FindAllCycles` function, including its behavior with empty graphs, single-node graphs, directed and undirected graphs, multiple cycles, disconnected graphs, negative edge weights, and large graphs. By testing these scenarios, we can ensure that the function is robust, correct, and performant in different use cases.
