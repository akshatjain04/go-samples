## Test Scenarios for BreadthFirstSearch Function

Here are some possible test scenarios for the `BreadthFirstSearch` function:

**Scenario 1: Connected with distance 1**

**Details:**
* Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies a connection between two nodes with a distance of 1.
* Execution:
    * Arrange: Create a graph with two nodes connected by an edge.
    * Act: Call `BreadthFirstSearch` with the starting and ending nodes.
    * Assert: Verify that the function returns `true` for `isConnected` and `1` for `distance`.
* Validation:
    * The assertion verifies that the function correctly identifies the connection and calculates the distance.
    * This test is important because it ensures the basic functionality of the algorithm for finding connections in a graph.

**Scenario 2: Connected with distance 2**

**Details:**
* Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies a connection between two nodes with a distance of 2.
* Execution:
    * Arrange: Create a graph with three nodes where the starting and ending nodes are connected through an intermediate node.
    * Act: Call `BreadthFirstSearch` with the starting and ending nodes.
    * Assert: Verify that the function returns `true` for `isConnected` and `2` for `distance`.
* Validation:
    * The assertion verifies that the function correctly identifies the connection and calculates the distance.
    * This test is important because it ensures the algorithm can handle connections with multiple hops.

**Scenario 3: Not connected**

**Details:**
* Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies when two nodes are not connected.
* Execution:
    * Arrange: Create a graph with two nodes that are not connected by any edges.
    * Act: Call `BreadthFirstSearch` with the starting and ending nodes.
    * Assert: Verify that the function returns `false` for `isConnected` and `0` for `distance`.
* Validation:
    * The assertion verifies that the function correctly identifies the lack of connection between the nodes.
    * This test is important because it ensures the algorithm doesn't incorrectly report connections where none exist.

**Scenario 4: Empty graph**

**Details:**
* Description: This test checks if the function handles an empty graph correctly.
* Execution:
    * Arrange: Create an empty graph with no nodes or edges.
    * Act: Call `BreadthFirstSearch` with any starting and ending nodes.
    * Assert: Verify that the function returns `false` for `isConnected` and `0` for `distance`.
* Validation:
    * The assertion verifies that the function handles the empty graph scenario correctly.
    * This test is important because it ensures the algorithm doesn't crash or produce unexpected results when dealing with empty graphs.

**Scenario 5: Invalid starting or ending node**

**Details:**
* Description: This test checks if the function handles invalid starting or ending nodes gracefully.
* Execution:
    * Arrange: Create a graph with valid nodes.
    * Act: Call `BreadthFirstSearch` with an invalid starting or ending node (e.g., a negative value or a value exceeding the number of nodes).
    * Assert: Verify that the function returns `false` for `isConnected` and `0` for `distance` and potentially logs an error message.
* Validation:
    * The assertion verifies that the function handles invalid input gracefully and doesn't produce unexpected results.
    * This test is important because it ensures the algorithm is robust and handles unexpected inputs without crashing.

These are just a few examples of test scenarios for the `BreadthFirstSearch` function. You can generate more scenarios by considering different edge cases, variations in graph structures, and potential error conditions. Remember to cover all aspects of the function's behavior to ensure it works correctly in all situations.
