## Test Scenarios for `findAllCyclesHelper`

### Scenario 1: No Cycles

**Description:** This scenario tests the function when there are no cycles in the graph.

**Details:**
* Arrange: Create a graph with no cycles.
* Act: Call `findAllCyclesHelper` with a starting vertex.
* Assert: Verify that the function returns `false` and an empty list of cycles.

**Validation:**
* The assertion verifies that the function correctly identifies the absence of cycles.
* This test is important to ensure that the function doesn't falsely report cycles in acyclic graphs.

### Scenario 2: Single Cycle

**Description:** This scenario tests the function when there is a single cycle in the graph.

**Details:**
* Arrange: Create a graph with a single cycle.
* Act: Call `findAllCyclesHelper` with a vertex within the cycle.
* Assert: Verify that the function returns `true` and a list containing the single cycle.

**Validation:**
* The assertion verifies that the function correctly identifies the cycle and returns it.
* This test is important to ensure that the function can detect and return cycles.

### Scenario 3: Multiple Cycles

**Description:** This scenario tests the function when there are multiple cycles in the graph.

**Details:**
* Arrange: Create a graph with multiple cycles.
* Act: Call `findAllCyclesHelper` with a vertex within one of the cycles.
* Assert: Verify that the function returns `true` and a list containing all the cycles.

**Validation:**
* The assertion verifies that the function correctly identifies all cycles and returns them.
* This test is important to ensure that the function can handle and return multiple cycles.

### Scenario 4: Starting Vertex Not in Cycle

**Description:** This scenario tests the function when the starting vertex is not part of any cycle.

**Details:**
* Arrange: Create a graph with cycles.
* Act: Call `findAllCyclesHelper` with a vertex that is not part of any cycle.
* Assert: Verify that the function returns `false` and an empty list of cycles.

**Validation:**
* The assertion verifies that the function correctly identifies that the starting vertex is not part of any cycle.
* This test is important to ensure that the function doesn't report cycles when the starting vertex is not involved.

### Scenario 5: Handling Unreachable Vertices

**Description:** This scenario tests the function when there are unreachable vertices in the graph.

**Details:**
* Arrange: Create a graph with unreachable vertices.
* Act: Call `findAllCyclesHelper` with a reachable vertex.
* Assert: Verify that the function doesn't explore unreachable vertices and returns the correct cycles.

**Validation:**
* The assertion verifies that the function correctly handles unreachable vertices and doesn't include them in the exploration.
* This test is important to ensure that the function doesn't get stuck exploring unreachable parts of the graph.

### Scenario 6: Empty Graph

**Description:** This scenario tests the function when the graph is empty.

**Details:**
* Arrange: Create an empty graph.
* Act: Call `findAllCyclesHelper` with any vertex.
* Assert: Verify that the function returns `false` and an empty list of cycles.

**Validation:**
* The assertion verifies that the function correctly handles empty graphs and doesn't report any cycles.
* This test is important to ensure that the function doesn't have unexpected behavior with empty graphs.

These scenarios cover various aspects of the `findAllCyclesHelper` function, including its ability to handle different cycle scenarios, starting vertices, and graph structures. They also test the function's behavior with empty graphs and unreachable vertices. This comprehensive set of test scenarios helps ensure the correctness and robustness of the function.
