## Test Scenarios for AddVertex function in graph package

**Scenario 1: Adding a new vertex to an empty graph**

**Details:**
This scenario tests the functionality of adding a new vertex to a graph that has no vertices yet.

**Execution:**
* Arrange: Create an empty graph with no vertices.
* Act: Call the AddVertex function with the vertex value.
* Assert: Verify that the graph now has one vertex and its corresponding key-value pair in the edges map.

**Validation:**
This test ensures that the AddVertex function correctly adds a new vertex to the graph and initializes its corresponding edge map entry.

**Scenario 2: Adding a duplicate vertex to a graph**

**Details:**
This scenario tests the behavior of adding a vertex that already exists in the graph.

**Execution:**
* Arrange: Create a graph with one vertex.
* Act: Call the AddVertex function with the same vertex value as the existing one.
* Assert: Verify that the graph still has only one vertex and the edges map remains unchanged.

**Validation:**
This test ensures that the AddVertex function does not add duplicate vertices to the graph and maintains the integrity of the existing edges.

**Scenario 3: Adding a vertex with a negative value**

**Details:**
This scenario tests the handling of adding a vertex with a negative value.

**Execution:**
* Arrange: Create an empty graph.
* Act: Call the AddVertex function with a negative vertex value.
* Assert: Verify that the function panics or throws an error indicating an invalid vertex value.

**Validation:**
This test ensures that the AddVertex function enforces valid vertex values and prevents the addition of invalid data to the graph.

**Scenario 4: Adding a vertex to a nil graph pointer**

**Details:**
This scenario tests the behavior of calling the AddVertex function with a nil graph pointer.

**Execution:**
* Arrange: Create a nil graph pointer.
* Act: Call the AddVertex function with a vertex value and the nil graph pointer.
* Assert: Verify that the function panics or throws an error indicating a nil receiver.

**Validation:**
This test ensures that the AddVertex function handles nil receiver scenarios gracefully and prevents unexpected behavior.

**Scenario 5: Adding a vertex to a large graph**

**Details:**
This scenario tests the performance and scalability of the AddVertex function when adding a vertex to a large graph with many existing vertices.

**Execution:**
* Arrange: Create a graph with a large number of vertices.
* Act: Call the AddVertex function with a new vertex value.
* Assert: Measure the time taken for the function to execute and verify that it remains performant even for large graphs.

**Validation:**
This test ensures that the AddVertex function scales efficiently with the size of the graph and maintains acceptable performance even for large datasets.

These are just some examples of test scenarios for the AddVertex function. You can create additional scenarios to cover more edge cases and specific requirements of your application.
