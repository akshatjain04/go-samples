ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=least_288573aa58

Scenario 1: Testing when both arrays are empty

Details:
  Description: This test checks the case when both q1 and q2 are empty arrays.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two empty arrays of nodes.
  Act: Invoke the `least` function with these arrays as input.
  Assert: Assert that the function should panic with an `index out of range` error since we are trying to access the first element of an empty array.
Validation:
  The assertion validates that handling and prevention of Out-of-index errors are necessary in these scenarios. It's crucial to test this scenario to ensure the function does not crash when provided with such inputs.

Scenario 2: Testing when q1 is empty and q2 has elements

Details:
  Description: The test is designed to check if the function correctly handles the scenario of q1 being empty but q2 having elements.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty array, and an array with a few nodes.
  Act: Call the `least` function with these arrays as input.
  Assert: Assert that the function returns the first element of q2, an empty array, and the remaining elements of q2
Validation:
  This assertion ensures that the function correctly handles the scenario where the first queue is empty, but the second queue isn't. It's important for recognizing the least element in this case.

Scenario 3: Testing when q2 is empty and q1 has elements

Details:
  Description: The test is designed to verify the function execution for the scenario where q2 is empty, and q1 has elements.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create one array with a few nodes, and one empty array.
  Act: Call the `least` function with these arrays as input.
  Assert: Assert that the function returns the first element of q1, the remaining elements of q1, and an empty array
Validation:
  This assertion confirms the function handles the case where the second queue is empty, but the first queue isn't. This is critical to make sure the correct least element is retrieved in this circumstance.

Scenario 4: Testing when both q1 and q2 have elements and q1[0] has a lesser or equal weight

Details:
  Description: This tests the case where both q1 and q2 have elements, and the first node of q1 has less than or equal to weight than the first node of q2.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two arrays with nodes that satisfy the scenario condition.
  Act: Call the least function with these arrays.
  Assert: Assert that the function returns the first node of q1, the remaining elements of q1, and q2
Validation:
  This assertion validates that the function gives preference to nodes in q1 when the first node weights are equal or q1[0] has a lower weight.

Scenario 5: Testing when both q1 and q2 have elements and q2[0] has lesser weight

Details:
  Description: This scenario checks when both arrays have elements and the first node of q2 has less weight than the first node of q1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two arrays with nodes, where the first element of q2 has less weight than q1.
  Act: Call the least function with these arrays as input.
  Assert: Assert that the function returns the first node of q2, q1, and the remaining elements of q2
Validation:
  This assertion validates that the function correctly identifies the node in q2 when it has less weight than the corresponding node in q1. This test also verifies the weighted comparison functionality.
