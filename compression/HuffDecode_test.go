Scenario 1: Testing HuffDecode with normal input

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the `HuffDecode` function behaves as expected when provided with normal inputs. We will create a binary tree and provide a set of booleans to be decoded.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a binary tree with a set of nodes, each containing a rune and its weight. A set of booleans will also be provided for decoding.
  Act: Invoke the `HuffDecode` function with the root node, a current node, the boolean input, and the output string.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the decoded string matches the expected string.
Validation:
  Assertion is chosen to directly match the result string with the expected string. The expected result logic is based on the Huffman decoding process. This test is important to ensure that the function is working correctly for normal inputs.

Scenario 2: Testing HuffDecode when given an empty boolean input

Details:
  Description: This scenario is meant to test the `HuffDecode` function's behavior when provided an empty boolean input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a binary tree with a set of nodes, each containing a rune and its weight. An empty boolean array will be used for input.
  Act: Invoke the `HuffDecode` function with the root node, current node, the empty boolean input, and the output string.
  Assert: Assert that the returned string matches the output string.
Validation:
  Assertion is chosen to directly match the returned string and the output string. The logic for the expected result is that when no input boolean array is given, no decoding can happen so the output remains the same. This test confirms that the function handles empty input situations correctly.

Scenario 3: Testing HuffDecode when given a nil root node

Details: 
  Description: This test is meant to check if the `HuffDecode` function handles nil root node inputs gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: A nil root node, a current node, a boolean input, and the output string will be used.
  Act: Invoke the `HuffDecode` function with a nil root node, a current node, a boolean input, and the output string.
  Assert: Assert that the function returns the output string without any modifications.
Validation:
  The assertion was chosen based on the reasoning that when a nil root node is passed in, the function should not be able to perform any decoding and hence should return the output string as it was passed in. The goal of this test is to safeguard against potential nil pointer dereferences.

Scenario 4: Testing HuffDecode when given an incomplete Huffman tree

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the `HuffDecode` function can handle cases where the Huffman tree is not fully formed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up an incomplete Huffman tree and provide it with a set of booleans that requires nodes missing from the tree.
  Act: Invoke the `HuffDecode` function with the incomplete tree, current node, boolean input, and output string.
  Assert: Test to ensure that the function doesn't cause a runtime error.
Validation:
  We are not looking for correct decoded strings here, but rather checking that the function handles missing nodes gracefully. This is important for verifying the resilience of the `HuffDecode` function.
