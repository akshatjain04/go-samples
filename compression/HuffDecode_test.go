Scenario 1: Testing input with no data

Details:
  Description: This test is designed to check if the function behaves as expected when a blank slice is passed as an input. 
Execution:
  Arrange: A test Node can be created with the symbol and weights. Let root and current pointers point to this Node. Pass an empty boolean slice array and an empty string as input.
  Act: Now, call HuffDecode passing the above inputs.
  Assert: The result should be compared. Since no data is passed, the function should return the current out string i.e., an empty string.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the output returned matches the expected outcome which in this case is an empty string. This is an important edge case to test as it helps us ensure the function behaves correctly when it receives no inputs or blank values.

Scenario 2: Testing decoding of a single node tree 

Details:
  Description: This test is designed to validate if our function handles the Huffman decoding correctly when the Huffman tree is of size 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: We insert a character into a Node. We prepare a boolean slice corresponding to that character with all elements as false.
  Act: We call the HuffDecode function passing the root Node pointer, the current Node pointer, the boolean slice, and an empty string.
  Assert: The result string should only contain the character in the single-node tree.
Validation:
  The importance of this test lies in verifying the minimum case i.e., when the Huffman tree has just one node and the input string has just one character. 

Scenario 3: Testing Decoding of a populated Huffman tree

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function successfully decodes a Huffman tree that is larger than a single node.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Node tree with multiple symbols and corresponding weights. Create a boolean slice that corresponds to these weights. 
  Act: We invoke HuffDecode on the root and current Node pointers of our Huffman tree, passing also the boolean slice and an empty string.
  Assert: The resultant string should match the original string used to generate the corresponding boolean slice and Huffman tree.
Validation:
  This is an important test scenario to confirm that the Huffman decoding function works with more complex root trees and larger slices of input data. 

Scenario 4: Testing Incorrect Decoding Path

Details:
  Description: This test is designed to check the function's behavior when an incorrect path is provided (i.e., a sequence of boolean values that do not correspond to any node in the Huffman tree)
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Huffman tree of any size. The input slice should have a sequence of boolean values that do not lead to a leaf node.
  Act: We call HuffDecode with our setup.
  Assert: The function is not expected to return any meaningful value as the input does not represent any sequence in the given Huffman tree.
Validation:
  This verifies Huffman Decoding's reaction to incorrect input thus providing an insight on how the function handles error input.
