ROOST_METHOD_HASH=HuffDecode_ebb4bbd4a7
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=HuffDecode_8f66fc0def

Scenario 1: Test with a non-leaf node as the current node

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the Huffman Decompression algorithm when the current node is not a leaf node (i.e., it has children nodes), and the function needs to traverse the tree.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Huffman tree with one parent and two child nodes where the parent is the root and current node.
    Act: Invoke the HuffDecode function with the arranged data.
    Assert: Check if the function navigates the Huffman tree correctly and returns an empty string, as the root node has no symbols.
Validation:
    The logic behind this is that Huffman Coding is a prefix-free coding system, so no character's bit string representation can be a prefix to another character's bit string. The importance of this test? It verifies that the function correctly traverses the Huffman tree when given a non-leaf node as its current node. 

Scenario 2: Test with a leaf node as the current node 

Details:
    Description: This test verifies how the Huffman Decompression algorithm performs when the current node is a leaf node (i.e., it has no children nodes), and it must interpret this as the end of a symbol.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Huffman tree with a single node that contains a symbol.
    Act: Invoke the HuffDecode function with the aforementioned data.
    Assert: Check whether the function correctly handles a symbol in a leaf node and appends it to the output string.
Validation:
    This scenario validates whether a symbol can be successfully obtained from a leaf and appended to the output string. 

Scenario 3: Test with an empty input slice

Details:
    Description: This test checks the behavior of the HuffDecode function when the input slice of bits is empty.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Huffman tree with one or more nodes. Invoke the function with an empty slice as the input.
    Assert: Determine if the function returns the initial output string without any changes because there are no new symbols to decode.
Validation:
    An empty slice means that all symbols have been decoded or that there was no input to begin with. This scenario tests if the function can successfully return the decoded string within this context.

Scenario 4: Test with input slice of one element

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to confirm the performance of the Huffman Decompression algorithm when the current bit to decode is the last bit.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Huffman tree and an input slice of one element.
    Act: Invoke the HuffDecode function with these.
    Assert: Establish if the function successfully decodes the final symbol and adds it to the output string.
Validation:
    This test scenario is vital to ensuring that the function can correctly handle the end of the input slice, which is fundamental to decompressing the last symbol in a message.
