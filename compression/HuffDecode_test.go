ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=HuffDecode_8f66fc0def

Scenario 1: Successful decoding of Huffman-encoded data

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check if the function successfully decodes Huffman-encoded data back into the original symbols. 

Execution:
Arrange: Create a Huffman encoding tree with the Node structure, an encoded slice of boolean values, and a decrypted empty string.
Act: Invoke the HuffDecode function, passing in the root of the tree, current node as the root, the encoded boolean slice, and the empty string. 
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual results match the original symbols that were encoded.

Validation:
The assertion confirms that the Huffman encoding-decoding process can perfectly reverse the encoding process. The test is crucial as the decryption process should accurately represent the original data for the function to be useful in any Huffman encoding-decoding process.

Scenario 2: Decoding process when the encrypted data is an empty slice

Details:
Description: This test is meant to cover the scenario where the Huffman-encoded data input to the function is an empty slice. 

Execution:
Arrange: Setup a Huffman encoding tree with the Node structure and an empty slice. 
Act: Invoke the HuffDecode function, passing in the root of the tree, current node as the root, and the empty slice. 
Assert: The resulting string should be empty as well.

Validation:
The assertion validates that when there's no input data to decode, the function correctly returns an empty string. This test is important as it’s checking the function’s ability to handle edge cases.

Scenario 3: Decoding process when the tree only has the root node

Details:
Description: This test aims to verify the functionality of the function when the Huffman encoding tree only has the root node.

Execution:
Arrange: Setup a tree that consists of only a root node and an encoded boolean slice.
Act: Call the HuffDecode function, passing in the root as the tree, current node as the root, and the encoded boolean slice.
Assert: The returned string should contain as many root node symbols as the length of the boolean slice.

Validation:
The assertion checks that the function handles the scenario when the Huffman tree has only a single node correctly. This test is important because it tests if the function can handle simple edge cases.

Scenario 4: Error handling when the Huffman tree is a null pointer

Details:
Description: This test covers the scenario when the Huffman tree provided to the function is a null pointer.

Execution:
Arrange: Set up a null pointer for the Huffman tree and an encoded boolean slice.
Act: Call the HuffDecode function, passing in the null pointer for the tree, the current node as the null pointer, and the encoded boolean slice.
Assert: The function should panic or fail gracefully.

Validation:
The assertion validates that the function has a mechanism to handle null pointers without causing a runtime panic. This test is crucial as it ensures the robustness and stability of the Huffman decoding function.
