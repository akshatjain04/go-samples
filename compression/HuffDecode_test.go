Scenario 1: Decoding Single Symbol Huffman Tree

Details:
    Description: This test will check the ability of the HuffDecode function to correctly decode a boolean array from a Huffman tree with only a single symbol. 

Execution:
    Arrange: Construct and use a Node with symbol 'b' for both root and current input parameters. Also, provide an empty string and empty boolean list. 
    Act: Invoke HuffDecode function with the constructed Huffman tree, and an empty boolean array as input parameters.
    Assert: Use Go testing framework to validate that the output string is equal to 'b'.
   
Validation:
    Assertion needs to verify that decoding with a single-symbol Huffman tree returns symbol of the node independently of input boolean array. It addresses how function behaves when minimum possible Huffman tree provided as an input. 

Scenario 2: Decoding Multilevel Huffman Tree With Right Traversal

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if HuffDecode function correctly decodes a multi-level Huffman tree traversed to the right.

Execution:
    Arrange: Construct a multi-level binary tree with root symbol -1, two child nodes will have symbols 'd' and -1, and the right child of the second child node will be 'h'. Call HuffDecode with in parameter being array of a single true value.
    Act: Call the HuffDecode function with the arranged input.
    Assert: Verify that the returned string is 'h'.

Validation:
    In this test, the chosen arrangement and assertion are drawn up to check if a Huffman tree can be decoded correctly when traversal goes to the right. The traversing logic of boolean inputs should demonstrate "taking the right path" when value equals true.

Scenario 3: Decoding Multilevel Huffman Tree With Left Traversal

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if HuffDecode function correctly decodes a multilevel Huffman tree traversed to the left.

Execution:
    Arrange: Construct a multi-level binary tree with root symbol -1, and two child nodes having symbols -1 and 'p'. And for the left child node put 'q'. Call HuffDecode with in parameter being array of a single false value.
    Act: Call the HuffDecode function with the arranged input.
    Assert: Verify that the returned string is 'q'.

Validation:
    The logic behind the expected result is that when a traverse instruction is false, the function is supposed to traverse to the left. This test helps us confirm that this aspect of the function works correctly.

Scenario 4: Decoding Empty Huffman Tree

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check how the HuffDecode function handles an empty Huffman Tree.

Execution:
    Arrange: Construct an empty Node for the root and current parameters. Also, provide an empty string and empty boolean list. 
    Act: Invoke the HuffDecode function with the arranged inputs.
    Assert: Use Go testing framework to validate that the output string is empty.
  
Validation:
    For an empty Huffman tree, the expected output is an empty string. This scenario handles the edge case for an empty Huffman tree. The test is required to validate that the function can handle an empty tree gracefully without errors.
