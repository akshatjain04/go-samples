```
Scenario 1: Normal operation of Huffman Decoding 

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the normal operation of the Huffman decoding function, specifically testing that it returns the correct decoded string given a properly structured Huffman binary tree with a properly encoded string. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Two 'current' nodes are created with valid symbols. The 'current' node and 'root' node are the same node. Boolean input 'in' is provided and the 'out' string is created as an empty string.
  Act: The HuffDecode function is invoked with adequate parameters representative of normal operation.
  Assert: Go testing facilities are used to assert that the resulting decoded string is as expected.
Validation:
  This assertion checks that the Huffman decoding function properly decodes a given encoded string as per the binary tree structure. This test is necessary to ensure that the function is correctly implemented and can decode strings properly.

Scenario 2: Empty input

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's response when passed an empty set of booleans for 'in' parameter. The expected behavior is that the function should return the 'out' string with no changes. 
Execution:
  Arrange: The binary tree nodes are made, and the function is given an empty array for 'in' and the current node is having valid symbol.
  Act: The HuffDecode function is invoked with the structured parameters
  Assert: Go testing facilities are used to assert that the function returns the 'out' string unchanged.
Validation:
  This test checks that the function correctly handles an empty input string. It helps to ensure that the function has been implemented correctly, and can handle edge cases elegantly.

Scenario 3: Current Node with invalid symbol

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the function when it encounters a current node with an invalid symbol (-1). This should trigger a new recursion process starting from the root node.
Execution:
  Arrange: A Huffman binary tree nodes are structured and an array of encoded booleans for 'in' are given. The current node symbol is set to -1.
  Act: The HuffDecode function is invoked with above parameters.
  Assert: Go testing facilities are used to assert whether the function correctly triggered a new recursion starting from the root node.
Validation:
  This test assures that the function can handle and correctly process nodes with invalid symbol, thereby diagnosing error properly. This test case is important in scenarios where the node symbol may be undefined or not properly set.

Scenario 4: All nodes towards left

Details:
  Description: This test ensure the correctness of the function when all nodes are towards the left direction of parent node in the binary tree and ensure that it still provides the correct decoded string.
Execution:
  Arrange: A binary tree is structured such that all nodes are towards left direction of their parent node. An array of encoded booleans for 'in' are 'false' and an 'out' string is provided as empty.
  Act: The HuffDecode function is invoked with above parameters.
  Assert: Go testing facilities are used to assert whether the function correctly provides the decoded string.
Validation:
  This test validates that the function correctly handles binary trees where all nodes are to the left direction. This test is important to ensure the function's robustness and reliability in different scenarios.
