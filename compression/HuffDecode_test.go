Scenario 1: HuffDecode with Empty Input Array

Details: 
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the 'HuffDecode' function when no input array is provided. 

Execution: 
  Arrange: Create leaf nodes with symbols and an empty boolean slice. 
  Act: Call the target function HuffDecode with the leaf nodes and the empty boolean slice.
  Assert: The output string should only contain the symbol from the non-root node.

Validation: 
  The assertion compares the expected output to the returned value from the HuffDecode function. If the input slice is empty, the function should only return symbols from the non-root nodes. This is a fundamental behavior of the Huffman decoding process and is important for confirming the correctness of the Huffman algorithm's implementation.

Scenario 2: Huffman Decoding of a Single Node 

Details: 
  Description: This test is meant to check the performance of the 'HuffDecode' function when provided with a single input node. 

Execution: 
  Arrange: Create a single leaf node with a symbol, and a boolean array of length 1.
  Act: Call the target function with the leaf node as root and current node, and a boolean slice of length 1.
  Assert: Assert that the output string only contains the symbol of the leaf node.

Validation: 
  This assertion verifies the result from the Huffman Decoding process and checks for the correctness of the returned string. This test is useful to confirm that the function can handle the edge case of a single node input, which is essential for ensuring the robustness of the Huffman decoding algorithm.

Scenario 3: Huffman Decoding with Non-Leaf Node

Details: 
  Description: This test is intended to inspect how the 'HuffDecode' function behaves when provided with a non-leaf node as input.

Execution: 
  Arrange: Create nodes forming a Huffman Tree structure, and a boolean slice.
  Act: Call the HuffDecode function, providing the root node as both the root and current nodes, a boolean slice as input.
  Assert: Check that the output string is the expected output after Huffman decoding.

Validation: 
  The logic behind this assertion is that when provided with a non-leaf node, the function should correctly traverse the Huffman tree according to the boolean slice and output the corresponding symbols. This test is necessary for validating the ability of the function to perform Huffman decoding on more complex input structures.

Scenario 4: Huffman Decoding with Invalid Input

Details: 
  Description: This test aims to check the function's behavior when given an invalid boolean slice.

Execution: 
  Arrange: Form nodes to make a Huffman Tree structure, and create a boolean slice that leads to a null node (invalid flow).
  Act: Call the HuffDecode function with this invalid boolean slice.
  Assert: The function should handle the error and not panic or fail.

Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the function can properly handle errors without panicking. This test is important for ensuring robustness and error handling in the Huffman decoding algorithm.
