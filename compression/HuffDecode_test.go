Scenario 1: Huffman decoding of a non-empty input with tree having symbols

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the correct working of the `HuffDecode` function when a Huffman tree containing symbols and a non-empty input is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Huffman tree with a set of nodes including symbols and weights, and a non-empty input array of boolean values.
  Act: Invoke `HuffDecode` with the created Huffman tree and input.
  Assert: Compare the output of `HuffDecode` with the expected decoded string.
Validation:
  The expected output is obtained from direct Huffman decoding or from a reference implementation. This test ensures that the function correctly handles normal inputs and that the Huffman decoding is being properly carried out, which is a core requirement of this function.

Scenario 2: Huffman decoding with an empty input

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the correct working of the `HuffDecode` function when an empty input is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Huffman tree with a set of nodes including symbols and weights, and an empty boolean array as input.
  Act: Invoke `HuffDecode` with the created Huffman tree and an empty input.
  Assert: Ensure that the output of `HuffDecode` is an empty string.
Validation:
  An empty input should result in an empty output, as Huffman decoding with no values should not produce any output. This test ensures that empty inputs are handled correctly and do not lead to unexpected behavior.

Scenario 3: Huffman decoding with a tree with no symbols

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the `HuffDecode` function when a Huffman tree with no symbols is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Huffman tree with nodes that do not have any symbols, and a non-empty input array of boolean values.
  Act: Invoke `HuffDecode` with the created Huffman tree and input.
  Assert: Ensure that the output of `HuffDecode` is an empty string.
Validation:
  A Huffman tree without any symbols would not yield any result, since there is no symbol to decode. The function should thus return an empty string. This test ensures that such situations are correctly handled, preventing crashes and ensuring stability.

Scenario 4: Huffman decoding with null Huffman tree

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the `HuffDecode` function when a null Huffman tree is given.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the root and current nodes of the Huffman tree as null, and setup a non-empty input array.
  Act: Invoke `HuffDecode` with the null Huffman tree and input.
  Assert: Expect a runtime error to occur as the tree is null.
Validation:
  The function is expected to fail when passed a null Huffman tree. This test ensures that the function can handle such exceptional cases gracefully, i.e. it should not crash the entire application but should stop with an appropriate error. This is important for the stability and robustness of the application.
