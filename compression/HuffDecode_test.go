Scenario 1: Normal HuffDecoding Test

Details:
  Description: This test aims to ensure that the function HuffDecode decodes a series of boolean values into a string correctly, following the Huffman coding rules.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a tree of Nodes using the provided struct, representing a basic Huffman Decoding tree. Define an array of boolean values to be decoded and an empty output string.
  Act: Call the HuffDecode function with the root of the tree, the root (as currents), the boolean array and the empty string.
  Assert: Verify that the output string matches the expected result.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is crucial in ensuring that the function is correctly taking a Huffman encoded array of boolean values and producing the correct string output. This is essential to ensure the Huffman decoding aspect of the data compression process is working as expected.

Scenario 2: Empty Input Test

Details:
  Description: This test aims to ensure the function behaves correctly when provided with an empty boolean input array.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a tree of Nodes as in the first test case. Define an empty boolean array and an empty output string.
  Act: Call the HuffDecode function with the root of the tree, the root (as currents), the empty boolean array and the empty string.
  Assert: Verify that the output string still remains empty.
Validation:
  Since the input boolean array is empty, the function should return an empty string irrespective of the tree. Testing this makes sure that the function behaves correctly when encountering corner cases such as this.

Scenario 3: Single Node Tree Test

Details:
  Description: This test intends to check the behaviour of the function with a tree consisting of a single node.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Huffman tree with only the root node. Define a boolean array and an empty output string.
  Act: Call the HuffDecode function with the root of the tree, the root (as currents), the boolean array and the empty string.
  Assert: Verify that the output string matches the symbol in the single node repeatedly for the size of the input boolean array.
Validation:
  The expected result is based on the principle of Huffman coding where a single node tree represents a single symbol. This test validates the function's ability to handle simple encoding scenarios.

Scenario 4: Null Tree Test

Details:
  Description: This test is performed to see how the function handles a null Huffman tree.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a null root and current node (nil value). Define a boolean array and an empty output string.
  Act: Call the HuffDecode function with the nil root and current node, the boolean array and the empty string.
  Assert: Expect a panic due to a runtime null pointer dereference.
Validation:
  This test checks the robustness of the function in dealing with improper inputs. In a normal scenario, the function is supposed to throw a panic in this case, as Huffman Decoding cannot be performed with a null tree.
