ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=HuffEncode_a7dbfab105

Scenario 1: Testing with valid data whose Huffman codes are known.

Details:
  Description: This scenario aims to ensure that the HuffEncode function works correctly with valid inputs. We will use known Huffman codes and a string to test the function.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the map of rune to slice of bool representing Huffman codes. Define a string with characters represented in the Huffman codes map.
  Act: Invoke the HuffEncode function with the defined Huffman codes map and the string.
  Assert: Verify the Huffman codes generated by the HuffEncode function corresponds to the string using Go's testing facilities.
Validation:
  It is important that the function performs a correct Huffman encoding with the given map and input string. The test result guarantees that the function can perform a basic Huffman encoding task. 

Scenario 2: Testing with an empty string.

Details:
    Description: This test case's purpose is to see how the function handles an empty string as input.
Execution:
    Arrange: Define the map with Huffman codes as before, but now make sure the input string is empty.
    Act: Call the HuffEncode function with the Huffman codes map and the empty string as arguments.
    Assert: Check if the output slice is empty.
Validation:
    This test verifies if the function correctly identifies that there are no runes in the input string to encode. It is crucial since an empty input string is a valid case that may happen in a real application and function should not break in case such input is passed.

Scenario 3: Testing with a string that contains rune not represented in Huffman codes map.

Details:
    Description: This test case's purpose is to check the function's output when input string contains a rune that is not represented in the Huffman codes map.
Execution:
    Arrange: Define Huffman codes map and a string which contains rune not present in the map.
    Act: Call the HuffEncode function with the defined map and the string.
    Assert: The expected behavior in this scenario would be function panicking as the string contains rune which is not present in Huffman codes map, hence can't be encoded.
Validation:
    This test verifies how the function handles cases when input string contains runes not present in Huffman codes. It's important as Huffman code map might not include all possible runes, and the application should not crash if such rune is encountered.
