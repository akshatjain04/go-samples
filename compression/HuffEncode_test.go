Scenario 1: Basic Huffman Encoding Scenario

Details:
  Description: This test scenario is intended to validate the basic encoding functionality of the HuffEncode function. It ensures that the function correctly encodes a string using the given Huffman codes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a map that holds runes as keys and slice of bools as values to simulate the Huffman codes. Also, prepare an input string.
  Act: Call the HuffEncode function with the prepared codes and input string.
  Assert: Check if the output matches the expected Huffman-encoded sequence.
Validation:
  The chosen assertion checks the exact equality of the encoded sequence, ensuring correctness down to individual bits. This ensures that the encoding process works perfectly, which is crucial for data compression and thus business efficiency.

Scenario 2: Empty Input Test

Details:
 Description: This test scenario ensures that HuffEncode properly handles empty input, resulting in an empty output and without any crashes or unexpected behaviour.
Execution:
 Arrange: Initialize an appropriate codes map as described before. This time, however, the input string is empty instead of a regular message.
 Act: Pass the empty input string along with the codes to HuffEncode and note the output.
 Assert: Confirm that the result is an empty slice of bools.
Validation:
 The assertion checks for an exact match with an empty slice. An empty input message should always result in an empty output, since there's nothing to encode. Making sure that the function handles empty inputs smoothly helps in achieving robustness.

Scenario 3: Invalid Rune Test

Details:
 Description: This test checks how the function reacts when it's provided a string containing runes not found in the Huffman codes dictionary.
Execution:
 Arrange: Create a typical Huffman codes map without including a set of runes present in the input string.
 Act: Call HuffEncode function with the prepared codes and string.
 Assert: Due to the presence of invalid runes, the test would fail. Therefore, this scenario could be carried out under a recover function and confirm that a panic occurred.
Validation:
 In the real world, handling of missing values is very relevant. Here, this test verifies that the application can respond correctly to a situation where one or more runes can't be encoded. This helps in recognizing if more error handling needs to be implemented.
