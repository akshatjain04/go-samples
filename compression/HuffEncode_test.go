ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=HuffEncode_a7dbfab105

Scenario 1: Successful HuffEncode encoding with non-empty input and codes

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the successful encoding of a string using the provided Huffman codes map.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a map of rune to boolean slice as Huffman codes and a non-empty string for encoding.
    Act: Invoke the HuffEncode function with the prepared Huffman codes and string.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the returned boolean slice matches the expected outcome.
Validation:
    The assertion validates that the encoded output matches the expected result, verifying the function's encoding logic. This test is crucial as it examines the function's primary operation - Huffman encoding.

Scenario 2: HuffEncode encoding with empty string input

Details:
    Description: This test is intended to check the behavior of the function when given an empty string for encoding.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a map of rune to boolean slice as Huffman codes and an empty string.
    Act: Invoke the HuffEncode function with the prepared Huffman codes and empty string.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the returned boolean slice is empty.
Validation:
    The assertion checks if the function properly handles the scenario of an empty string input, returning an empty boolean slice. This test is important as it examines the function's behavior when encountering an edge-case input.

Scenario 3: HuffEncode encoding with a string containing characters that have no corresponding Huffman code

Details:
    Description: This test is designed to examine the function's behavior when the input string contains characters that are not present in the provided Huffman codes map.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a map of rune to boolean slice as Huffman codes and a string that contains characters not present in the codes map.
    Act: Invoke the HuffEncode function with the prepared Huffman codes and string.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function behaves as expected under these conditions -
 it could either return an incomplete boolean slice or trigger a runtime error.
Validation:
    The assertion checks if the function can handle scenarios where the input string contains characters absent in the Huffman codes map. This test is vital as it verifies the function's robustness and error handling capabilities. 

Scenario 4: HuffEncode encoding with a nil Huffman codes map

Details:
    Description: This test is intended to check the function's behavior when the Huffman codes map is nil.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a nil map of rune to boolean slice as Huffman codes and a non-empty string for encoding.
    Act: Invoke the HuffEncode function with the prepared Huffman codes and string.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function behaves as expected under these conditions -
 it could either return an empty boolean slice or trigger a runtime error.
Validation:
    The assertion checks the function's robustness and ability to handle scenarios where the Huffman codes map is nil. This test is significant to ensure the function's error resilience.

Scenario 5: HuffEncode encoding with a non-ASCII string input 

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function can handle non-ASCII strings for encoding.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a map of rune to boolean slice as Huffman codes and a non-ASCII string for encoding.
    Act: Invoke the HuffEncode function with the prepared Huffman codes and string.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the returned boolean slice matches the expected outcome.
Validation:
    The assertion validates that the function works correctly with non-ASCII strings and that the resulting encoded output matches the expected result. This test verifies the function's Unicode support and robustness.
