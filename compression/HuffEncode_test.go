ROOST_METHOD_HASH=HuffEncode_da396c0331
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=HuffEncode_a7dbfab105

Scenario 1: Normal operation where the Huffman encode function is supplied with valid values.
  
  Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the normal operation of the Huffman encoding function. The encoding function is supplied with a valid map of runes to boolean slices, along with a valid input string. The goal here is to ensure the output of the function aligns with the input provided.
  
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a map of runes to boolean slices and a string to be encoded.
    Act: Invoke the HuffEncode function with the prepared map and string.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the returned boolean slice matches our expected output.
    
  Validation:
    The assertion matches our expected output Boolean slice with the actual output. If the assert is true, then the function works as expected. This test is important to ensure that the function works correctly when appropriate values are given.
    
  
Scenario 2: Edge case where the input string is empty.
  
  Details:
    Description: This test will verify how the function handles an empty input string. The Huffman encoding algorithm should return an empty boolean slice in this case.
    
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a map of runes to boolean slices and an empty string.
    Act: Invoke the HuffEncode function with the prepared map and empty string.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns an empty boolean slice.
    
  Validation: 
    The assertion confirms that the function returns an empty Boolean slice when it is given an empty string. This test is important to the application's behavior because it tests the function's capacity to handle edge cases.
  
  
Scenario 3: Edge case where the input string contains a rune that is not in the provided codes map.

  Details:
    Description: This scenario checks what happens when the input string contains a rune that is not represented in the map. As the implementation does not account for this, we expect an out of range error.
  
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a map of runes to boolean slices and a string that contains a rune not represented in the map.
    Act: Invoke the HuffEncode function with the prepared map and string.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to anticipate a panic due to an out-of-range error.
  
  Validation:
    The assertion is anticipating a panic, which would be the expected result if the function is used in a situation it is not prepared to handle. It's important to test this kind of scenario to ensure robust error handling in the application.
  

Scenario 4: Edge case where the provided map is empty.

  Details:
    Description: This scenario tests what happens when the provided map is empty. We should expect a panic due to the out-of-range error since the function does not accommodate an empty map.
  
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an empty map and a valid string.
    Act: Invoke the HuffEncode function with the empty map and string.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to anticipate a panic due to an out-of-range error.
  
  Validation:
    The assertion is anticipating a panic, which would be the expected result if the function is used in a situation it is not prepared to handle. This test scenario is crucial to ensure the application can cope with unexpected situations and provide relevant error handling.
