Scenario 1: Valid HuffEncoding with non-null left and right nodes

Details:
Description: This test is meant to verify functionality when Huffman Encoding function is invoked with valid non-null left and right child nodes. This will further validate the accurate copying and extension of the prefix for each node based on its position in the tree.

Execution:
Arrange: Create a Huffman node with symbol as -1, left and right child nodes. Also, a prefix of []bool and a map of rune to bool slices.
Act: Call HuffEncoding with the created Huffman node, prefix, and map.
Assert: Validate if the map has been updated correctly with appropriate codes for each symbol in the tree.

Validation:
The assertion checks if the Huffman codes assigned to each symbol are correct and ensures the effective traversal of the tree. This test is crucial to confirm the proper execution of the Huffman encoding method which is fundamental for any compression application.


Scenario 2: Valid HuffEncoding with a null right node

Details:
Description: This test is for checking the correct behavior of the HuffEncoding function when the root node has only a left child node. This scenario mimics the condition when a Huffman tree has a singular left-sided path.

Execution:
Arrange: Create a Huffman node with symbol as -1, non-null left child node and null right node, a prefix of []bool and a map of rune to bool slices.
Act: Call HuffEncoding with the created Huffman node, prefix, and map.
Assert: Verify if the map is updated correctly with the correct prefix for each symbol found in the left-sided tree.

Validation:
The assertion validates if the function is capable of handling an asymmetric tree structure but still assigns the right codes to each symbol. This test is important because in real life, the tree structure might be asymmetric based on the weight of each symbol.


Scenario 3: Testing scenario where the symbol is not -1

Details:
Description: This test is to affirm that when a valid symbol is found (not equal to -1), the function assigns the current prefix to that symbol in the map. This scenario mimics the condition when a leaf node is reached in Huffman tree traversal.

Execution:
Arrange: Create a Huffman node with symbol other than -1, and no child nodes. Also, create a prefix of []bool and a map of rune to bool slices.
Act: Call HuffEncoding with the created Huffman node, prefix, and map.
Assert: Check if the map is updated with the correct symbol and prefix pair.

Validation:
The assertion checks if the functions appropriately assigns the current prefix to a symbol when a leaf node is encountered. This test is vital as the accurate assignment of prefixes to symbols is core to Huffman encoding.
