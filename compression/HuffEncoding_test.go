ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=HuffEncoding_6d6c7bee1c

Scenario 1: Test whether Huffman Encoding Works with Single Node
  Details:
    Description: This test checks whether the Huffman encoding works correctly when only a single node is being encoded.
    Execution:
    Arrange: Create a single node with a specified symbol and weight.
    Act: Call the HuffEncoding function with this node, an empty prefix, and an empty map.
    Assert: Check whether the map of codes has one entry, matching the symbol of the node with an empty prefix.
  Validation: 
    The reason for this assertion is because a single-node Huffman tree would encode its lone symbol with an empty prefix. It validates that the correct encoding is conducted even if there is only one node. 
  
Scenario 2: Test whether Huffman Encoding Works for a Balanced Tree
  Details:
    Description: This test is to ensure that the Huffman encoding assigns correct prefix codes to symbols of a perfectly balanced Node tree. 
    Execution:
    Arrange: Create a balanced Node tree with symbols and weights.
    Act: Call the HuffEncoding function providing the root node, an empty prefix, and an empty map.
    Assert: Check whether the map of codes has appropriate corresponding keys and values.
  Validation: 
    The reason for this assertion is a balanced Huffman tree with nodes of equal weights should assign prefix codes that are of equal length. This ensures that the encoding works correctly for balanced trees. 

Scenario 3: Test Function Behavior with Nil Node
  Details:
   Description: This test case is designed to check the behavior of the HuffEncoding function when a nil Node is provided.
    Execution:
    Arrange: N/A (No nodes are required for this scenario).
    Act: Invoke the HuffEncoding function with a nil Node, an empty prefix, and a new symbols map.
    Assert: Ensure that the symbols map is still empty after function execution.
  Validation: 
    It is expected that the function can handle nil Nodes without failing and without adding any entries to the map. This allows for more robust function usage.

Scenario 4: Test Function Behavior with Large Huffman Tree
  Details:
    Description: This test is designed to check the behavior of the HuffEncoding function when a large tree is provided.
    Execution:
    Arrange: Construct a large Huffman tree, with a depth of at least 10. Assign symbols and weights as appropriate.
    Act: Call the HuffEncoding function with this tree, an empty prefix, and an empty map.
    Assert: Check if the appropriate keys and values exist in the map of codes after the function call.
  Validation:
    This test ensures that the function can handle larger trees and still provide the correct result. This is important to ensure the function's scalability.

Scenario 5: Encoding Tree with Non-unique Symbols
  Details:
    Description: This test is designed to check the behavior of the HuffEncoding function when a tree with non-unique symbols is provided.
    Execution:
    Arrange: Construct a Huffman tree with non-unique symbols.
    Act: Call the HuffEncoding function with this tree, an empty prefix, and an empty map.
    Assert: Check if the map of codes contains the correct keys and values after the function call.
  Validation:
    The Huffman encoding algorithm should handle symbols with variable frequency by according a shorter encoding for more frequent symbols, regardless of whether they are unique or not. This test ensures that the implementation is correctly following the algorithm.
