Scenario 1: Normal operation with binary tree of symbols and weights

Details:
  Description: This test will verify if the HuffEncoding function correctly generates Huffman encodings for symbols in a binary tree, which are weighted according to their frequency of occurrence.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Node linked list - the huffman tree, with each node having a symbol and weight. Initialize a slice of bool (prefix) and a map of runes to slices of bool (codes).
  Act: Call HuffEncoding on the root node of the tree, with the prefix and the codes map as parameters.
  Assert: Check if the codes map is filled correctly with the symbol as key and its huffman encoding as value.
Validation: 
  The map of huffman codes should match the expected values based on the symbol weight in the binary tree. This function is critical for generating the compressed encoding of a set of symbols.

Scenario 2: Edge case with single-node tree

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's functionality when it is only working with a tree with one node.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a custom single-node tree and initialize an empty prefix and codes map.
  Act: Call HuffEncoding with the root node (which would be the only node) of the tree, the prefix, and the codes map.
  Assert: Verify that the codes map is correctly filled with the single symbol and its huffman encoding (which should be an empty slice as there is only one symbol).
Validation: 
  In this case, the assertion should support a map with a single symbol paired to an empty prefix. This is relevant to check how the function handles minimum input.

Scenario 3: Error handling with null root node

Details:
  Description: This test is designed to validate the function's error handling when provided with a null root node.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an empty slice of bool for the prefix and an empty map for the codes. 
  Act: Call HuffEncoding with a null root node.
  Assert: Assert that the prefix and codes map remain empty as there are no nodes to process in the tree.
Validation: 
  The function should not arbitrarily fill the code map and it should remain empty. This assertion verifies that the function can handle null inputs smoothly.

Scenario 4: Testing with an unbalanced Huffman tree

Details:
  Description: This test will verify if the function correctly calculates Huffman encodings for an unbalanced tree.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an unbalanced Huffman tree of nodes with a symbol and weight each, initialize an empty slice of bool (prefix) and a map of runes to slices of bool (codes).
  Act: Call HuffEncoding on the Huffman tree root, with a prefix and codes map as parameters.
  Assert: Check if the codes map is accurately filled with Huffman encoding without any errors.
Validation: 
  The Huffman encoding should be correct even if the tree is unbalanced. This assures the general functionality of calculating Huffman codes.
