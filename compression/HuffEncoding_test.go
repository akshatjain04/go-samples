Scenario 1: Test for a single node tree with correct HuffEncoding

Details:
  Description: The test checks whether HuffEncoding can determine correct encoding when given a single node tree (just one root node). This represents its simplest use case.
Execution:
  Arrange: We create a new struct of type Node with a predefined symbol and weight to represent the root node.
  Act: Call the 'HuffEncoding' function with the root node.
  Assert: Check if the result in 'codes' match the expected coding. It should contain the symbol of the root node and an empty slice (since a single node tree has no route).
Validation:
  The expected HuffEncoding of a single node tree is an empty slice and the assertion validates this. This ensures that the function behaves as expected for simplest input, contributing to its overall correct function.

Scenario 2: Complete and balanced binary tree

Details:
  Description: This test verifies whether the function correctly creates Huffman coding when a fully grown, balanced binary tree is an input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Generate a balanced binary tree with each Node having a unique symbol and uniform weight. 
  Act: Call the 'HuffEncoding' function with the root node of the binary tree.
  Assert: Confirm if the coding in 'codes' has correct values (unique bool slice for each node).
Validation:
  The test verifies the function's ability to correctly encode a balanced binary tree, where all paths are equally weighted. This covers a more complex use case.

Scenario 3: Test for unevenly populated tree with leaf nodes at different depths

Details:
  Description: This test verifies whether HuffEncoding correctly handles uneven trees. That is, steeply sloping trees with leaf nodes at various levels.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an uneven binary tree with Nodes at various levels.
  Act: Call the 'HuffEncoding' function with the root node of the tree.
  Assert: Verify that 'codes' correctly represents the unequal path lengths to each Node (varying length of []bool).
Validation:
  This test case answers the question: does the function correctly handle unbalanced input? The unequal path lengths will result in different lengths of []bool which must be represented in the output 'codes'. This test case is of great significance as most Huffman trees are unbalanced.

Scenario 4: Test for an empty tree

Details:
  Description: This test verifies whether HuffEncoding handles input of an empty tree correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Invoke HuffEncoding with 'node' as nil.
  Act: Call the 'HuffEncoding' function with nil as the root node.
  Assert: Check if 'codes' remain empty after function execution.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that for an empty input (nil root node, thus an empty tree), the function output is also empty ('codes' is unchanged). It helps make sure that the function doesn't break when facing an edge case of the simplest tree possible.
