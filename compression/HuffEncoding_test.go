Scenario 1: Test HuffEncoding with a single node

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the Huffman Encoding algorithm when called with a single node. The node will have an associated symbol and not have any child nodes.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a single node with a specific symbol and weight.
    Act: Call HuffEncoding with the node, an empty prefix slice, and an empty codes map.
    Assert: The symbol associated with the single node is assigned the empty prefix as its code in the codes map.
Validation:
    Since Huffman Encoding assigns shorter codes to nodes with higher weights, a single node should have an empty prefix given its weight doesn't affect its assigned code. This holds importance in validating the basic functionality of the Huffman Encoding implementation.

Scenario 2: Test HuffEncoding with a weighted binary tree

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the Huffman Encoding algorithm on a weighted binary tree, where nodes with higher weights should receive shorter codes.
Execution:
    Arrange: Construct a weighted binary tree with multiple nodes, each associated with distinct symbols and weights.
    Act: Call HuffEncoding with the root of the tree, an empty prefix slice, and an empty codes map.
    Assert: Check the generated codes for each symbol and validate the generated Huffman Encoding, the nodes with higher weights have shorter codes.
Validation:
     This test validates the core functionality of Huffman Encoding which is used for compression purposes.

Scenario 3: Test HuffEncoding with an unbalanced binary tree

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the Huffman Encoding algorithm on an unbalanced binary tree. It is important to validate the algorithm doesn't only work on perfectly balanced trees.
Execution:
    Arrange: Construct an unbalanced binary tree with distinct symbols and weights.
    Act: Call HuffEncoding with the root node of the tree, an empty prefix slice, and an empty codes map.
    Assert: Check the generated codes for each symbol and validate the generated Huffman Encoding, ensuring the nodes with higher weights have shorter codes.
Validation:
    Validates that the Huffman Encoding algorithm works efficiently on unbalanced trees as well, which could comprise various real-world datasets.

Scenario 4: Test HuffEncoding with empty node i.e., nil node

Details:
Description: This test validates whether the algorithm can handle cases when it's executed with an empty node.
Execution:
    Arrange: No need to create nodes as we are testing with an empty node.
    Act: Call HuffEncoding with nil as the node parameter, an empty prefix slice, and an empty codes map.
    Assert: The function should not return any error as there is no symbol to add to the map.
Validation:
    A robust Huffman Encoding implementation should not break or generate an error when called with an empty node. Instead, it should just return without modifying the map. This is an important requirement to ensure the safety of calling this function in a larger, potentially unpredictable codebase.
