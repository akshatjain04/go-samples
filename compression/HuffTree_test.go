Scenario 1: Valid Huffman Tree Creation

Details:
  Description: This test is designed to check if the function is able to create a valid Huffman tree using a non-empty list of symbol-frequency pairs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a list of symbol-frequency pairs with known frequency values.
  Act: Invoke HuffTree with the created list of SymbolFreq.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the returned node is not nil, and no error is returned.
Validation:
  We know what the desired output should be for the given input. Asserting that the returned node is not nil and no error is returned confirms the function's ability to create a Huffman tree correctly. This test case is important as it validates the normal operation of the function.

Scenario 2: Empty Frequency List

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly handles an empty list of symbol-frequency pairs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty list of SymbolFreq.
  Act: Invoke HuffTree with the empty list.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the returned node is nil, and the returned error matches the error for the empty list scenario.
Validation:
  We expect the function to return a specific error message when the input list is empty. Asserting that the returned error matches the expected error validates the function's error handling mechanism. This test scenario ensures that the function is robust and handles this edge case correctly.

Scenario 3: Single Item Frequency List

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function can correctly handle a scenario with a single item in the frequency list.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a list of SymbolFreq with only a single item.
  Act: Invoke HuffTree with the single item list.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the returned node's weight is equal to the single item's frequency, and no error is returned.
Validation:
  The weight of the returned node should equal the frequency of the only item in the list. This assertion validates the function's output in scenarios with a single item list. It is important since the function has to work correctly for all valid inputs, including edge cases.

Scenario 4: Frequency List With Multiple Same Frequencies

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's operation when multiple items in the list have the same frequency.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a list of SymbolFreq where multiple items have the same frequency.
  Act: Invoke HuffTree with the multi-item same-frequency list.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the returned node is not nil, no error is returned and the weight of the returned node equals the sum of frequencies of all the items.
Validation:
  In a Huffman tree, the weight of the root node is the sum of frequencies of all the items. This assertion validates whether the function correctly handles scenarios where multiple items have the same frequency. Such test scenario covers specific functionality and helps ensure the function's accuracy in creating Huffman trees.
