ROOST_METHOD_HASH=HuffTree_ac22fe1c5c
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=HuffTree_83ede9c810

Scenario 1: Valid input with varying frequencies 

Details: 
The test is meant to check whether the function can handle regular valid input with varying frequencies correctly.

Execution:
Arrange: Set up a list of SymbolFreq objects with normal valid values.
Act:  Invoke the function HuffTree with the arranged list of SymbolFreq.
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual returned Node object has correct structure and relationships, and the error returned is nil.

Validation: 
This assertion checks if the function can correctly build a Huffman tree with the provided input of varying frequencies. This is important for testing the basic functionality of the algorithm underscoring the function.

Scenario 2: List of SymbolFreq with the same frequencies

Details: 
The test is meant to check whether the function can handle a situation where all symbols have the same frequencies.

Execution:
Arrange: Create a list of SymbolFreq objects where all have the same frequency.
Act: Invoke the function HuffTree with the arranged list of SymbolFreq.
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual returned Node object has correct structure and relationships, and the error returned is nil.

Validation: 
This assertion checks if the function can correctly build a Huffman tree when all input symbol frequencies are same. This scenario tests the ability of function to handle unusual yet valid input cases.

Scenario 3: Empty list of SymbolFreq

Details:
The test is intended to verify if the function correctly handles and returns an appropriate error message when called with an empty list of SymbolFreq.

Execution:
Arrange: Create an empty list of SymbolFreq objects.
Act: Invoke the function HuffTree with the empty list.
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the returned Node object is nil and the error returned is not nil and contains an appropriate message.

Validation:
The assertion verifies that the function correctly handles an edge case when no input is given. This is a crucial test to ensure that the function will not fail or return incorrect results when given empty input.

Scenario 4: List of SymbolFreq containing one element

Details:
The test is meant to check if the function can handle a scenario where there is only one symbol frequency given.

Execution:
Arrange: Create a list of SymbolFreq objects containing only one element.
Act: Invoke the function HuffTree with the single-element list of SymbolFreq.
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual returned Node object contains only one node with correct value, and the error returned is nil.

Validation:
This assertion checks if the function can correctly build a Huffman tree when only one input symbol frequency is given. This scenario tests the ability of function to handle edge yet valid input case.
