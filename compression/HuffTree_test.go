Scenario 1: Test HuffTree with valid symbol-frequency list

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check if the HuffTree function works as expected when provided with a valid symbol-frequency list. 

Execution:
Arrange: Set up a valid symbol-frequency list, for instance, [{Symbol: 'A', Freq: 3}, {Symbol: 'B', Freq: 2}, {Symbol: 'C', Freq: 1}].
Act: Invoke the HuffTree function passing the symbol-frequency list.
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the result is a *Node pointing to a root of Huffman tree and does not produce an error.

Validation: 
The Node produced should hold the whole picture of Huffman tree. The frequency sum of the root should equal to the sum of all frequencies in the symbol-frequency list. This test is important to validate the business requirements of the Huffman coding algorithm.

Scenario 2: Test HuffTree with an empty symbol-frequency list

Details:
Description: This test aims to verify how the HuffTree function handles a scenario where it gets an empty symbol-frequency list.

Execution:
Arrange: Set up an empty symbol-frequency list.
Act: Invoke the HuffTree function passing the empty list.
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to check that the function returns a nil Node pointer and an error.

Validation:
In this case, the function should return an error because Huffman Tree requires at least one symbol-frequency pair to work. This test ensures that the function appropriately handles empty input which is a common edge case.

Scenario 3: Test HuffTree with a single element in the symbol-frequency list

Details:
Description: This test ensures that HuffTree function can handle the edge case when there is only a single element in the symbol-frequency list.

Execution:
Arrange: Set up a symbol-frequency list containing only one pair, for example, [{Symbol: 'A', Freq: 3}].
Act: Invoke the HuffTree function with this list.
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the result is a *Node which has a valid Huffman tree structure and does not produce an error.

Validation:
The test confirms if the function can handle symbol-frequency with a single element, by returning a valid *Node. This edge case test ensures that Huffman tree is constructed appropriately when there is only one symbol-frequency pair.

Scenario 4: Test HuffTree with unusual characters in the symbol-frequency list

Details:
Description: This test aims to check if the HuffTree function can handle unusual characters included in the symbol-frequency list like space, tab, or newline.

Execution:
Arrange: Set up a symbol-frequency list with unusual characters, for example, [{Symbol: '\n', Freq: 2}, {Symbol: '\t', Freq: 3}].
Act: Call the HuffTree function passing the unusual characters list.
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function can handle unusual characters and returns a valid *Node representing Huffman tree for these unusual characters.

Validation:
Huffman coding should not be restricted to alphabets or digits, it should adapt to all types of rune characters. Testing unusual characters ensures the function supports comprehensive inputs. This test has significant importance when it comes to compressing files that might contain a variety of characters.
