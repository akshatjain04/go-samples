ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=HuffTree_83ede9c810

Scenario 1: Normal Operation Test

Details:
    Description: This test checks the normal operation of the HuffTree function providing a valid input list of symbol-frequency pairs.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a valid list of symbol-frequency pairs.
    Act: Invoke the HuffTree function with the prepared list.
    Assert: Validate that the function correctly returns a pointer to the root of the Huffman tree and no error.
Validation:
    The assertion checks that an expected Huffman tree is returned and no error occurs. This test is crucial as it validates the main functionality of the function.

Scenario 2: Empty list Input Test

Details:
    Description: This test scenario aims at verifying the function's behavior when an empty list is provided as an input.
Execution:
    Arrange: Provide an empty list as an input.
    Act: Invoke HuffTree function.
    Assert: The function should return a nil pointer and an error message indicating an empty list was provided.
Validation:
    This choice of assertion validates the correctness of the input provided to the function. It ensures that the function gracefully handles wrong inputs and communicates the problem to the user.

Scenario 3: Single Element List Test

Details:
    Description: This scenario is meant to test the case where the list contains a single symbol-frequency pair.
Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a list with only one symbol-frequency pair.
    Act: Call the HuffTree function with this list.
    Assert: The function should return a pointer to a node representing the single element in the list and no error.
Validation:
    This test is important for checking if the function properly handles the edge case of a singleton list. The expected outcome validates that the function can handle this case and generate the correct Huffman tree.

Scenario 4: Multiple Elements with Same Frequency Test
    
Details:
    Description: This test scenario checks the situation when the input list contains multiple elements with the same frequency.
Execution:
    Arrange: Construct a list with several symbol-frequency pairs having the same frequency.
    Act: Invoke the HuffTree function with this list.
    Assert: The function should return a pointer to a valid Huffman tree that represents the input list, and no error message.
Validation:
    This test case checks the scenario where the frequencies are equal, which could potentially influence the building of the Huffman tree. Itâ€™s important to verify the function can handle this situation correctly.

Scenario 5: Negative Frequency Test

Details:
    Description: This scenario validates how the function handles negative frequencies.
Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a list with at least one symbol-frequency pair that has a negative frequency.
    Act: Call the HuffTree function with this list.
    Assert: As negative frequencies don't make sense in this context, the function should respond appropriately.
Validation:
    This case is essential for verifying that the function can handle invalid inputs, in this case, negative frequencies.
