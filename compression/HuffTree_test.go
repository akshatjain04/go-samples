Scenario 1: Testing HuffTree with a single symbol-frequency pair

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the correct operation of the HuffTree function when provided a single symbol-frequency pair. This tests the basic functionality of the function and helps in ensuring the function can handle minimal inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a single element list of SymbolFreq structure with any rune symbol and frequency.
  Act: Invoke the HuffTree function with the prepared list of SymbolFreq.
  Assert: Verify if the returned Node contains the correct symbol and weight. Also, ensure there is no error returned.
Validation:
  Utilizing single element list helps in identifying if the function is able to process minimal inputs and can correctly create a proper Node structure. The importance of this test is to check if the function can handle the simplest input correctly without any errors.

Scenario 2: Testing HuffTree with multiple symbol-frequency pairs

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to examine the functionality of HuffTree function when it is provided multiple symbol-frequency pairs. This assesses the regular behavior of the function.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a list of SymbolFreq having more than one set of symbol and its frequency.
  Act: Call the HuffTree function by giving the prepared SymbolFreq list.
  Assert: Validate if the returned Node has the correct tree structure as per Huffman coding algorithm. Also, ensure no error is returned.
Validation:
  Running this test using multiple symbol-frequency pairs ensures the actual purpose of the function, Huffman coding, is implemented correctly and creating the Node structure as expected. 

Scenario 3: Testing HuffTree when given an empty list

Details:
  Description: This test aims to verify how the function behaves when given an empty list of symbol-frequency pairs. It checks the functionâ€™s ability to handle and return an error for invalid inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an empty list of SymbolFreq structure.
  Act: Call the HuffTree function with the prepared list.
  Assert: Check if the function returns a nil Node and error message indicating calling method with an empty list of symbol-frequency pairs.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for checking if the function correctly identifies and responds to invalid inputs. It also ensures the function provides understandable feedback (via error messages) which would be needed to rectify the issue.  

Scenario 4: Testing HuffTree for large inputs

Details:
  Description: This test imitates a scenario where HuffTree needs to handle a large dataset. It checks the function's effectiveness and performance in such situations.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a large list of SymbolFreq structures with random frequencies and symbols.
  Act: Invoke the HuffTree function using the prepared list.
  Assert: Confirm if the function executes successfully without any runtime errors, and the returned Node has the correct structure as per Huffman coding.
Validation:
  This validation ensures the function can handle large data inputs and still function optimally while providing accurate results. This is important to ensure the function can be used in real-world scenarios where the data may vary in size.
