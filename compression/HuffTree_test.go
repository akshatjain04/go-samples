Scenario 1: Normal operation with Multiple SymbolFreq Entries

  Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check for normal operation of the HuffTree function, provided a list of SymbolFreq entries. Each SymbolFreq struct contains a symbol and the corresponding frequency. The function is expected to construct a Huffman Tree based on the frequencies of the symbols and return the root node of the tree. No error is expected in this scenario.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a list of SymbolFreq entries with different symbols and frequencies.
    Act: Invoke the HuffTree function using the list of SymbolFreq.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual results match the expected outcomes.
  Validation:
    The choice of assertion is to verify that the root node of the tree, returned by the function, has the correct symbol and weight. The sum of weights of all the nodes in the tree should be equal to the total frequency of all symbols. This test is important to verify the correct behavior of the function when provided valid and diverse inputs.

Scenario 2: Edge case with Single SymbolFreq Entry

  Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check whether the HuffTree function can handle a list with a single SymbolFreq entry. The function is expected to return a tree with a single node that represents the provided symbol-frequency pair. No error is expected in this scenario.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a list with a single SymbolFreq entry.
    Act: Invoke the HuffTree function using the list of SymbolFreq.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual results match the expected outcomes.
  Validation:
    The choice of assertion is to verify that the root node of the tree, returned by the function, accurately represents the single symbol-frequency pair. The weight of the root node should be equal to the frequency of the symbol. This test is important to assure the function can handle edge cases with minimal inputs.

Scenario 3: Edge case with Empty List of SymbolFreq

  Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check whether the HuffTree function can handle an empty list. The function is expected to return a nil pointer and an error message indicating that the list is empty.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up an empty list.
    Act: Invoke the HuffTree function using the empty list.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to confirm that the returned node is nil and the error message is as expected.
  Validation:
    The choice of assertion is to verify that the function accurately throws an error when not provided with any inputs. This test is important to ensure the function has sufficient error handling and performs validation checks.
