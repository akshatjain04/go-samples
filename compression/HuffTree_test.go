Scenario 1: Valid Huffman Tree Creation
  Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the normal operation of the "HuffTree" function when valid input is provided. It should verify that a correct Huffman tree is returned based on the provided list of frequency-symbol pairs.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create and populate a slice of SymbolFreq structs with valid data. (e.g., []SymbolFreq{SymbolFreq{'a', 5}, SymbolFreq{'b', 9}, SymbolFreq{'c', 12}, SymbolFreq{'d', 13}})
    Act: Call HuffTree with the prepared SymbolFreq slice.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to ensure the returned Huffman tree's structure is correct and contains nodes representing the correct frequency-symbol pairs.
  Validation: 
    The choice of assertion here is to verify the correct operation of the Huffman Tree creation. A correct tree ensures efficient data compression, crucial in any context where data storage or transmission efficiency is important. 

Scenario 2: Empty Frequency-Symbol List
  Details:
    Description: This test is meant to verify the function's behavior when provided with an empty SymbolFreq slice. It should produce an error indicating an empty list of symbol-frequency pairs.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare an empty slice of SymbolFreq structs.
    Act: Call HuffTree with the empty SymbolFreq slice.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to check for the presence of the expected error message.
  Validation:
    The handled error in this case indicates that the function behaves correctly when provided with an empty input, rather than attempting an invalid operation. Detecting and handling invalid inputs is an important part of robust function design.

Scenario 3: Frequency-Symbol Pairs with Zero Frequency
  Details:
    Description: This test checks the function's handling of frequency-symbol pairs with a zero frequency value. The returned tree should not include such pairs.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a slice of SymbolFreq structs that includes some with a zero frequency. (e.g., []SymbolFreq{SymbolFreq{'a', 0}, SymbolFreq{'b', 9}, SymbolFreq{'c', 12}, SymbolFreq{'d', 13}})
    Act: Call HuffTree with the prepared SymbolFreq slice.
    Assert: Check that the returned Huffman tree does not include nodes representing zero-frequency pairs.
  Validation:
    This test scenario ensures that the Huffman Tree creation algorithm correctly filters out meaningless frequency-symbol pairs from the input.

Scenario 4: Single Symbol-Frequency Pair input
  Details:
    Description: This test is meant to verify that the function correctly handles a case where only one symbol-frequency pair is given, returning a valid Huffman tree.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a slice of SymbolFreq structs with a single entry. (e.g., []SymbolFreq{SymbolFreq{'a', 5}})
    Act: Call HuffTree with the prepared SymbolFreq slice.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to ensure that returned Huffman tree's structure is correct and contains nodes representing the lone frequency-symbol pair.
  Validation:
    This scenario verifies that the function can handle minimal valid input, creating a valid Huffman Tree even for a single input pair.
  
Note: Due to missing code (function `least` is not provided), actual behavior in some scenarios might not align completely with the provided examples.
