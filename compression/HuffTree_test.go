Scenario 1: Nominal case with list of symbol and frequency
Details:
    Description: This test case is meant to check a normal operation for the function HuffTree. The list of symbol and frequencies will be used to create a new node and its siblings.
Execution:
    Arrange: Provide a list of SymbolFreq containing valid symbol along with their frequencies.
    Act: Invoke the HuffTree method with the appropriate parameters.
    Assert: Check if the output is a tree node and no error was raised.
Validation:
    The node's weights and symbols will correspond to the provided data. This test ensures that the function creates the correct nodes with the given symbol and frequencies.

Scenario 2: Case with an empty list
Details:
    Description: This test case tests the error handling of the function when an empty list of SymbolFreq is passed. The function is expected to return an error.
Execution:
    Arrange: Provide an empty list of SymbolFreq.
    Act: Invoke the HuffTree method with the provided empty list.
    Assert: Ensure that the result of the function is nil and the error reported explains that the list was empty.
Validation:
    The function should correctly identify the problem and report an error. This is crucial as it prevents further program crashes and allows the problem to be corrected by the caller.

Scenario 3: Case where a symbol has a 0 frequency
Details:
    Description: This test case tests the functionality of the function when a symbol with 0 frequency is passed. The function should correctly build the tree considering the 0 frequency.
Execution:
    Arrange: Provide a list of SymbolFreq where at least one of the symbols has 0 frequency.
    Act: Invoke the HuffTree method with the provided list.
    Assert: Check if the output tree correctly mirrors the input.
Validation:
    The function should handle a 0 frequency correctly. It is expected that the function will create a leaf node with the provided symbol, and the 0 frequency won't affect the tree's structure. This test ensures that the function correctly handles all valid frequencies.

Scenario 4: Case with repeated symbols
Details:
    Description: This test case tests for scenarios where repeated symbols are in the Frequency list. The function should create different nodes for those symbols.
Execution:
    Arrange: Provide a list of SymbolFreq with some repeated symbols.
    Act: Invoke the HuffTree method with the provided list.
    Assert: Check if the output tree correctly replicates the input.
Validation:
    The function should handle repeated symbols correctly, creating different nodes for each symbol. This test ensures that the function can correctly handle real-world data where symbols often repeat.
