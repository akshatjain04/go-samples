) *SqrtDecomposition[E, Q] 
Scenario 1: Initialization with non-empty integer slice

Details:
  Description: Test the initialization of SqrtDecomposition with a non-empty slice of integers. The test checks if the blocks are correctly initialized using the provided query and union functions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a non-empty slice of integers and define the querySingleElement, unionQ, and updateQ functions appropriate for integer operations.
  Act: Invoke the NewSqrtDecomposition function with the created slice and functions.
  Assert: Verify that the blocks are initialized correctly and the blockSize is set as expected.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that each block's value is the result of the union operation on the elements of the corresponding block, and that the blockSize is the square root of the length of the elements rounded up. This test ensures that the decomposition structure is initialized correctly for basic integer operations, which is fundamental for the correctness of further operations on the data structure.

Scenario 2: Initialization with empty slice

Details:
  Description: Ensure that the SqrtDecomposition can be initialized with an empty slice without causing runtime errors or invalid states.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use an empty slice and define the querySingleElement, unionQ, and updateQ functions.
  Act: Invoke the NewSqrtDecomposition function with the empty slice.
  Assert: Check that the resulting blocks are an empty slice and blockSize is zero.
Validation:
  The empty input scenario is important to validate because it tests the robustness of the function against edge cases. The expected result is an empty set of blocks and a blockSize of zero, indicating no elements to process. This test is crucial to ensure the function can handle edge cases gracefully.

Scenario 3: Initialization with floating-point numbers

Details:
  Description: Test the initialization with a slice of floating-point numbers to verify the generic handling of different data types.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a non-empty slice of floats and define the querySingleElement, unionQ, and updateQ functions for float operations.
  Act: Invoke the NewSqrtDecomposition function with the created slice and functions.
  Assert: Confirm that the blocks are initialized correctly, taking into account floating-point precision, and the blockSize is set accurately.
Validation:
  The assertion checks the correct behavior of the function when dealing with floating-point numbers, which may include precision nuances. It validates that the decomposition is correctly set up for different data types and the generic type parameters are working as intended.

Scenario 4: Large input slice

Details:
  Description: Test the behavior and performance when initializing SqrtDecomposition with a very large input slice.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a large slice with a significant number of elements and define the querySingleElement, unionQ, and updateQ functions for appropriate operations.
  Act: Invoke the NewSqrtDecomposition function with the large slice.
  Assert: Validate that the blocks and blockSize are correctly set and the function executes within a reasonable time frame.
Validation:
  This test scenario is important for assessing the scalability of the function. The assertion ensures that the function can handle large input sizes efficiently and that the decomposition is accurate, which is crucial for performance-sensitive applications.

Scenario 5: Non-associative union function

Details:
  Description: Test the initialization with a non-associative union function to ensure the order of operations is correctly applied during block initialization.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a non-empty slice of elements and a non-associative union function. Define the querySingleElement and updateQ functions.
  Act: Invoke the NewSqrtDecomposition function with the provided parameters.
  Assert: Confirm that the blocks are initialized in a manner that respects the non-associativity of the union function.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function respects the order of operations, which is crucial when the union operation is non-associative. This test is important to verify that the SqrtDecomposition can be used with any arbitrary union operation correctly.

Scenario 6: Error handling with nil functions

Details:
  Description: Verify that the function handles nil querySingleElement, unionQ, or updateQ functions gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Pass nil for one or more of the function parameters while keeping the others valid.
  Act: Invoke the NewSqrtDecomposition function with the nil function parameter(s).
  Assert: Expect the function to handle the nil functions appropriately, potentially by returning an error or a nil SqrtDecomposition instance.
Validation:
  The test scenario is crucial for error handling, ensuring that the function does not panic or cause undefined behavior when provided with nil function arguments. Proper handling of such cases is important for the robustness of the code.
