Scenario 1: Initialization with non-empty integer slice

Details:
  Description: Test the initialization of SqrtDecomposition with a non-empty slice of integers. The test checks if the blocks are correctly initialized and the blockSize is calculated as expected.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a non-empty slice of integers and define functions for querySingleElement, unionQ, and updateQ that operate on integers.
  Act: Invoke the NewSqrtDecomposition function with the created slice and functions.
  Assert: Verify that the blocks are initialized correctly, the blockSize is set as expected, and the length of the blocks slice matches the expected number of blocks.
Validation:
  The assertion will check that the blockSize is the square root of the length of the input slice, rounded up to the nearest integer. The number of blocks is the ceiling of the element count divided by the blockSize. This test is important to ensure that the decomposition structure is initialized correctly for basic operations.

Scenario 2: Initialization with empty slice

Details:
  Description: Test the initialization of SqrtDecomposition with an empty slice to ensure that the structure can handle empty data sets without errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty slice and define stub functions for querySingleElement, unionQ, and updateQ.
  Act: Invoke the NewSqrtDecomposition function with the empty slice and stub functions.
  Assert: Verify that the blockSize is set to 0 and the blocks slice is empty.
Validation:
  The assertion will check for an empty blocks slice and a blockSize of 0, which is the expected behavior when initializing with no elements. This test verifies the function's robustness in handling edge cases.

Scenario 3: Initialization with custom types

Details:
  Description: Test the initialization of SqrtDecomposition with custom types to ensure that the generic type parameters are handled properly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a slice of a custom struct type and define functions for querySingleElement, unionQ, and updateQ that operate on the custom types.
  Act: Invoke the NewSqrtDecomposition function with the custom slice and functions.
  Assert: Verify that the blocks are initialized correctly, taking into account the custom logic provided in the functions.
Validation:
  The assertion will check that the blocks are initialized according to the custom logic provided by the functions and that the blockSize is calculated correctly. This test ensures that the generic types work as intended and that the function is versatile.

Scenario 4: Initialization with floating-point numbers

Details:
  Description: Test the initialization of SqrtDecomposition with a slice of floating-point numbers to verify that the decomposition works with non-integer types.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a slice of float64 and define functions for querySingleElement, unionQ, and updateQ that operate on float64.
  Act: Invoke the NewSqrtDecomposition function with the created slice and functions.
  Assert: Verify that the blocks and blockSize are initialized correctly, with proper handling of floating-point arithmetic.
Validation:
  The assertion will check that the blockSize is calculated correctly, considering the nuances of floating-point division and rounding. The test ensures that the function can handle different numeric types accurately.

Scenario 5: Large input slice

Details:
  Description: Test the initialization of SqrtDecomposition with a very large input slice to verify that the function can handle large datasets without performance degradation or errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a large slice of integers and define functions for querySingleElement, unionQ, and updateQ.
  Act: Invoke the NewSqrtDecomposition function with the large slice and functions.
  Assert: Verify that the blocks and blockSize are initialized correctly and that the function completes within a reasonable time frame.
Validation:
  The assertion will check the correctness of the initialization and measure the execution time to ensure it is within acceptable limits. This test is important for assessing the scalability of the function.

Scenario 6: Non-associative unionQ function

Details:
  Description: Test the initialization of SqrtDecomposition with a non-associative unionQ function to ensure that the order of element processing does not affect the final result.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a slice of elements and define a non-associative unionQ function, along with appropriate querySingleElement and updateQ functions.
  Act: Invoke the NewSqrtDecomposition function with these functions and the slice.
  Assert: Verify that the order of processing (left-to-right) in the initialization does not lead to incorrect block values.
Validation:
  The assertion will check that the blocks contain the correct values despite the non-associativity of the unionQ function. This test is important to ensure that the function behaves predictably with different types of union operations.
